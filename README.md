Full transcript: 2019 Democratic debate Night One, sortable by topic
We annotated the debate transcript so you can find candidate answers on the top issues of the night.

LESTER HOLT:

Good evening, everyone. I'm Lester Holt, and welcome to the first Democratic debate to the 2020 race for president.
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE:

Hi, I'm Savannah Guthrie. And tonight, it's our first chance to see these candidates go head to head on stage together.
We'll be joined in our questioning time by our colleagues, Jose Diaz-Balart, Chuck Todd, and Rachel Maddow.
HOLT:

Voters are trying to nail down where the candidates stand on the issues, what sets them apart, and which of these presidential hopefuls has what it takes.
GUTHRIE:

Well, now it's time to find out.
ANNOUNCER:

Tonight, round one. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio. Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Washington Governor Jay Inslee. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke. Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan. And Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.
From NBC News, "Decision 2020," the Democratic candidates debate, live from the Adrienne Arsht Performing Arts Center in Miami, Florida.
HOLT:

And good evening again, everyone. Welcome to the candidates and to our audience here in Miami here in the Arts Center and all across the country. Tonight we're going to take on many of the most pressing issues of the moment, including immigration, the situation unfolding at our border, and the treatment of migrant children.
GUTHRIE:

And we're going to talk about the tensions with Iran, climate change, and of course, we'll talk about the economy, those kitchen table issues so many Americans face every day.
DIAZ-BALART:

And some quick rules of the road. Before we begin, 20 candidates qualified for this first debate. We'll hear from 10 tonight and 10 more tomorrow. The breakdown for each was selected at random. The candidates will have 60 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for any follow-ups.
HOLT:

Because of this large field, not every person will be able to comment on every topic, but over the course of the next two hours, we will hear from everyone. We'd also like to ask the audience to keep the reactions to a minimum. We are not going to be shy about making sure the candidates stick to time tonight.
GUTHRIE:

All right. So with that business out of the way, we want to get to it. And we'll start this evening with Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Senator, good evening to you.
ELIZABETH WARREN:

Thank you. Good to be here.
GUTHRIE:

You have many plans -- free college, free child care, government health care, cancellation of student debt, new taxes, new regulations, the breakup of major corporations. But this comes at a time when 71 percent of Americans say the economy is doing well, including 60 percent of Democrats. What do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?
WARREN:

So I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It's doing great for giant drug companies. It's just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.
It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African-Americans and Latinx whose families are torn apart, whose lives are destroyed, and whose communities are ruined.
It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.
When you've got a government, when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on. And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.
GUTHRIE:

Senator Klobuchar, you've called programs like free college something you might do if you were, quote, "a magic genie." To be blunt, are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering giving your voters, people, a false sense of what's actually achievable?
AMY KLOBUCHAR:

Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity. And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what's going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.
So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids. I do. But I think my plan is a good one. And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.
My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college. There's many paths to success, as well as certifications.
Secondly, I'd used Pell grants. I'd double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.
And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans. Because I can tell you this:  If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
GUTHRIE:

That's time, thank you. Congressman O'Rourke, what we've just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable. In that vein, some Democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70 percent on the very highest earners, those making more than $10 million a year. Would you support that? And if not, what would your top individual rate be?
BETO O'ROURKE:

This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn't. And it's going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.
O'ROURKE:

Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That's how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest. A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.
A new democracy that is revived because we've returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now...
GUTHRIE:

Congressman O'Rourke…
O'ROURKE:

That's how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.
GUTHRIE:

Congressman, that's time, sir. I'll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question. Would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate? Yes, no, or pass?
O'ROURKE:

I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same right...
GUTHRIE:

Seventy percent?
O'ROURKE:

... that you -- you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent. You would generate the revenues...
GUTHRIE:

OK, that's time.
O'ROURKE:

... you need to pay for the programs we're talking about.
GUTHRIE:

That's time. Thank you.         Senator Booker, there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations, as you know. Senator Warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. You've said we should not, quote, "be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process." Why do you disagree?
CORY BOOKER:

I don't think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can't make a living wage.
We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs. And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that's hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.
One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.
And I'll tell you this. I live in a low-income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street's rankings, is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
GUTHRIE:

But quickly, Senator Booker, you did say that you didn't think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out, as Senator Warren has. Briefly, why is that?
BOOKER:

Well, again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it, number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.
At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they're trying to influence Washington. It's about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country...
GUTHRIE:

That's time, sir.
BOOKER:

We need to have someone that's a champion for them.
GUTHRIE:

Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, I mentioned you...
GUTHRIE:

Are you picking winners and losers?
WARREN:

So the way I understand this, it's there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country. That hurts workers. It hurts small businesses. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall.
And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy.
Now, look, we've had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What's been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants. That's part of the corruption in this system.
It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.
GUTHRIE:

Thank you.
HOLT:

Secretary Castro, the next question is for you. Democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades. What would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country?
JULIÁN CASTRO:

Thank you very much for that question, Lester. You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent. And I know what it's like to struggle. I know what it's like to rent a home and to worry about whether you're going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they're women.
I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.
And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. It's past time that we did that. And, you know, we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
HOLT:

All right, thank you. I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard. Your thoughts on equal pay?
TULSI GABBARD:

First of all, let's recognize the situation we're in, that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful. That's not what we have right now.
I enlisted in the Army National Guard after the Al Qaida terror attacks on 9/11 so I could go after those who had attacked us on that day. I still serve as a major. I served over 16 years, deployed twice to the Middle East, and in Congress served on the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Affairs for over six years.
I know the importance of our national security, as well as the terribly high cost of war. And for too long, our leaders have failed us, taking us from one regime change war to the next, leading us into a new cold war and arms race, costing us trillions of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives.
This insanity must end. As president, I will take your hard-earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs, things like health care, a green economy, good-paying jobs, protecting our environment, and so much more.
DIAZ-BALART:

Mayor De Blasio, good evening. You're the mayor of the biggest city in the United States, but it's also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor. How would you address income inequality?
BILL DE BLASIO:

Well, we've been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people's lives.
But let me tell you, what we're hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear. This is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we're supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy. Yes, we're supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when they're not serving our democracy.
This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive. And in New York, we've proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people. And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there's not enough money. What I say to them every single time is, there's plenty of money in this world, there's plenty of money in this country. It's just in the wrong hands. Democrats have to fix that.
DIAZ-BALART:

Congressman Delaney, do you agree?
JOHN DELANEY:

I think we have to do real things to help American workers and the American people. Right? This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage. And I've called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers.
Then we've got to fix our public education system. It's not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that. You know, I'm very different than everyone else here on the stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small- to mid-sized businesses all over the country, 5,000 of them I supported. The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities.
I know how to create jobs. We need a short-term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we're creating jobs everywhere in this country.
DIAZ-BALART:

Thank you. Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?
JAY INSLEE:

Well, I'm a little bit surprised. I think plans are great, but I'm a governor. And we've got to realize the people who brought us the weekend, unions, need -- are going to bring us a long overdue raise in America.
And I'm proud of standing up for unions. I've got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally. I marched with the SEIU folks. It is not right that the CEO of McDonald's makes 2,100 times more than the people slinging cash at McDonald's.
And the next thing I'll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future. Look it, Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs. And we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future.
IBEW members, machinists, we're doing it in my state today. And then we can do what America always does:  lead the world and invent the future and put people to work. That's what we're going to do...
DIAZ-BALART:

So, Congressman Ryan, President Trump, and you just referred to him, promise of manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of Ohio. Can you make that same promise?
TIM  RYAN:

Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let's say the president came, he said don't sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio. And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 -- 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility. That rippled throughout our community. General Motors got a tax cut. General Motors got a bailout. And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they're going to produce to Mexico.
I've had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China. My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we're talking about here, it's been going on 40 years. This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.
The bottom 60 percent haven't seen a raise since 1980. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth. We need an industrial policy saying we're going to dominate building electric vehicles, there's going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years. I want half of them made in the United States. I want to dominate the solar industry...
DIAZ-BALART:

Thank you.
RYAN:

... and manufacture those here in the United States.
DIAZ-BALART:

Senator Warren, are they coming back? Are these jobs coming back?
WARREN:

So we've had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it's basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they're going to do it.
So here's what I propose for an industrial policy. Start with a place where there's a real need. There's going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water. And we can be the ones to provide that. We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward.
And then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research. They can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America.
And then we have to double down and sell it around the world. There's a $23 trillion market coming for green products. We should be the leaders and the owners, and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing jobs here in America.
DIAZ-BALART:

Thank you.
WARREN:

We can do this.
HOLT:

All right. We're going to turn to the issue of health care right now and really try to understand where there may or may not be daylight between you. Many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan? Just a show of hands, start off with.
All right, well, Senator Klobuchar, let me put the question to you. You're one of the Democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government health care plan. Why is an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overhaul?
KLOBUCHAR:

Well, I think it's a bold approach. It's something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act. And that is a public option.         I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says. So let me go on beyond that.         There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals. The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people's heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.
For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that's what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it.
And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. And pharma thinks they own Washington? Well, they don't own me.
HOLT:

Your time is up. Thank you. Senator Warren, you signed on to Bernie Sanders' Medicare for all plan. It would put essentially everybody on Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage. Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?
WARREN:

So, yes. I'm with Bernie on Medicare for all. And let me tell you why.
I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke. And one of the number-one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. And that's not just for people who don't have insurance. It's for people who have insurance.
Look at the business model of an insurance company. It's to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for all solves that problem.
And I understand. There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights...
HOLT:

Congressman O'Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance. This year, you're saying you're no longer sure. Can you explain why?
O'ROURKE:

My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he'd been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, he was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated -- because he doesn't have health care -- he'll be dead before the age of 40.
So getting to guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal. The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, to be -- the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today.         And health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible.
Our plan says that if you're uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you're insufficiently insured, you can't afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you're a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you're able to keep it.
HOLT:

Your time is up.
O'ROURKE:

We preserve choice by making sure everybody has care.
HOLT:

Your time is up, Congressman, but I do want to ask a follow-up on this. Just to be very clear -- I'll give you 10 seconds -- would you replace private insurance?
O'ROURKE:

No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for...
DE BLASIO:

Wait, wait, wait. Congressman O'Rourke, Congressman O'Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses. It's not working. How can you defend a system that's not working?
O'ROURKE:

That's right. So for those for whom it's not working, they can choose Medicare. For the...
DE BLASIO:

Congressman...
O'ROURKE:

... who I listen to...
DE BLASIO:

... you've got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people.
O'ROURKE:

... they're able to keep them.
DE BLASIO:

Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?
DELANEY:

... 100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans -- I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what's working and fixes what's broken.
I mean, doesn't that make sense? I mean, we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?         And also it's bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close.
And the Medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. So to some extent, we're supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing. I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right?         I actually grew up in a working-class family. He loved the health care that the IBEW gave him. And I just always think about my dad in anything I would do from a policy perspective. He'd look at me and he'd say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American. But why are you taking my health care away?
HOLT:

I've let this -- I've let this play out a little bit because I'm fascinated to hear the daylight between you. Congresswoman Gabbard, why don't you weigh in here?
GABBARD:

I think we're talking about this in the wrong way. You're talking about one bill over another bill. Really, what we're talking about is our objective, making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the health care that they need.
I believe Medicare for all is the way to do that. I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for all program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need.
I also think that...
HOLT:

Senator...
GABBARD:

... if you -- if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance, so I think that's what we've got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need, regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.
HOLT:

Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thanks.
HOLT:

Let me turn to Senator Booker on this. Senator Booker, explain to me where you are. This is hugely important to people. So tell us where you are.
BOOKER:

I absolutely will. First of all, we're talking about this as a health care issue, but in communities like mine, low-income communities, it's an education issue, because kids who don't have health care are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs and employment, because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work. It's even a retirement issue, because in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care.
And so where I stand is very clear. Health care -- it's not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for all.         But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I'm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. And on this debate, I'm sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers.
Literally, the overhead for insurances that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare's overhead is only at 2 percent. We can do this better. And every single day, I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal...
HOLT:

Your time is up, Senator.
BOOKER:

... which is every American having health care.
HOLT:

Time is up, Senator. I want to...
HOLT:

I want to move back, if I can, to Congresswoman Gabbard...
WARREN:

... point, though, and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion. And that doesn't count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington.
We have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is, because it's not working for families, but it's sure as heck working for them.
WARREN:

It's time for us to make families come first.
INSLEE:

It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.
And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman's right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I'm the only candidate who has passed a public option. And I respect everybody's goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that's actually advanced the ball. And we've got to have access for everyone. I've done it as a public option.
HOLT:

Your time...
HOLT:

Senator Klobuchar, I want to get you...
UNKNOWN:

That's a false claim.
HOLT:

I am fascinated by this. Senator -- Senator Klobuchar?
KLOBUCHAR:

I just want to say, there's three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose. I'll start with that.
And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care. And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way. And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered.
So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.
HOLT:

Secretary Castro, this one is for you. All of you on stage support a woman's right to an abortion. You all support some version of a government health care option. Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
CASTRO:

Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice.
And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman -- or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose. And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.         More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade and will respect it and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.
HOLT:

Senator Warren, would you put limits on -- any limits on abortion?
WARREN:

I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services, and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.
And I want to add on that. It's not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. Forty-seven years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided, and we've all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protections...
HOLT:

Your time is up, Senator.
WARREN:

We now have an America where most people support Roe v. Wade. We need to make that a federal law.
HOLT:

Senator, thank you. Jose?
DIAZ-BALART:

Lester, thank you. Senator Booker, I want to kind of come back on a discussion we were having about health and the opioid crisis. You represent a state where 14 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies are based. Should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do?
BOOKER:

They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible. This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.
And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we've tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
DIAZ-BALART:

Congressman O'Rourke, how would you deal with it?
O'ROURKE:

Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars. It's the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it.
And yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we're seeing throughout this country, they've been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail.
Unless there's accountability and justice, this crisis will continue. In my administration, we will hold them to account. We will make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who've been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.
HOLT:

I know immigration is on a lot of your minds here. And I want to talk about it. We're going to talk about it in a moment. We need to take a break. We'll be back with more from Miami after this.
DIAZ-BALART:

We want to turn to an issue that has been in the news, especially this week. There are undocumented children being held alone in detention, even as close as Homestead, Florida, right here, less than 30 miles from where we are tonight. Fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the United States of America.
We saw that image today that broke our hearts, and they had names. Oscar Martinez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country. Last month, more than 130,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border.
Secretary Castro, if you were president today, hoy, what would you specifically do?
CASTRO:

Thank you very much, Jose. I'm very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan. And we saw those images, watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off.
If I were president today -- and it should spur us to action. If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump's zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy -- this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
DIAZ-BALART:

On day one. Sorry, I'm just going to ask...
CASTRO:

On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering. And then I would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven't committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship.
And then we'd get to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.
DIAZ-BALART:

Senator Booker, what would you do on day one? And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
BOOKER:

Yes. On day one, I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border Policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border.
Number two... I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here.
And then, finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and think that we're going to get border security. We actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both.
CASTRO:

... if I might -- if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point. You know, my plan -- and I'm glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this. My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.
(APPLAUSE)         And here's why it's important. We see all of this horrendous family separation. They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.
(UNKNOWN):

Thank you.
(UNKNOWN):

Jose...
CASTRO:

And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.
DIAZ-BALART:

Thirty seconds.
BOOKER:

As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue, but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn't just go on at our border. It happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work. We must end those policies, as well.
DE BLASIO:

We have to change the discussion about in this country...
DIAZ-BALART:

Mayor?
DE BLASIO:

... because look at the bottom line here. Those tragic -- that tragic photo of those -- that parent, that child -- and I'm saying this as a father. Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values.
But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we're not being honest about the division that's been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you're falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn't do that to you.
(APPLAUSE)         The big corporations did that to you. The 1 percent did that to you. We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants. But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we're going to be on their side every single time against those big corporation who created this mess to begin with. And remind people we're all in this together.
If we don't change that debate, that politics that's holding us back, we won't get all these reforms people are talking about. That's what we need to do as Democrats.
DIAZ-BALART:

If I could, I'm sorry. What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House??
O'ROURKE:

We would not turn back Valeria and her father, Oscar. We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws. We would not build walls. We would not put kids in cages. In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already... and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution...
CASTRO:

... repeal of Section 1325.
O'ROURKE:

We would make sure...
DIAZ-BALART:

Secretary, let him finish. And I will give you... But let him finish. Let him finish.
O'ROURKE:

We would not detain any family fleeing violence, in fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today. We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost. And then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, free Dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there's no reason to make that 2,000 mile journey to this country.
DIAZ-BALART:

Thank you. Secretary, I'll give you 30 seconds.
CASTRO:

Let's be very clear. The reason that they're separating these little children from their families is that they're using Section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them.
Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O'Rourke, have not. And I want to challenge all of the candidate to do that.
CASTRO:

I just think it's a mistake, Beto. I think it's a mistake. And I think that -- that if you truly want to change the system, that we've got to repeal that section. If not...
DIAZ-BALART:

Thank you.
CASTRO:

... then it might as well be the same policy.
O'ROURKE:

Let me respond to this very briefly. As a member of a Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don't criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.
CASTRO:

I'm not talking about -- I'm not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.
O'ROURKE:

If you're fleeing -- if you're fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure...
CASTRO:

I'm talking about -- I'm talking about everybody else.
O'ROURKE:

... I want to make sure you are treated with respect.
CASTRO:

I'm still talking about everybody else.
O'ROURKE:

But you're looking at just one small part of this. I'm talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.
CASTRO:

That's not true.
O'ROURKE:

And if you do that, I don't think it's asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.
CASTRO:

That's actually not true. I'm talking about millions of folks -- a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum. A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right? And you said recently that the reason you didn't want to repeal Section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking.
But let me tell you what:  Section 18, title 18 of the U.S. code, title 21 and title 22, already cover human trafficking.
I think that you should do your homework on this issue. If you did your homework on this issue, you would know that we should repeal this section.
DIAZ-BALART:

This is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time, and we will for a long time.
DELANEY:

Can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here?
DIAZ-BALART:

Let's -- Lester -- Lester -- I'm sorry, Savannah -- I know, it's just -- we could go on.
DELANEY:

But rather than talk about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country...
GUTHRIE:

You'll get your chance.
DELANEY:

... and what we're going to do to actually make a difference in these countries.
GUTHRIE:

Congressman, you'll get your chance. Let's continue the discussion.
Senator Klobuchar...
KLOBUCHAR:

Yes.
GUTHRIE:

Let's talk about what Secretary Castro just said. He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border. Do you support that? Do you think it should be a civil offense only? And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?
KLOBUCHAR:

Immigrants, they do not diminish America. They are America. And I am happy to look at his proposal. But I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.
What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here. And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries. Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries.
We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories. We need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas.
And this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants. And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible and get it done. It brings the debt down by $158 billion.
GUTHRIE:

Senator...
KLOBUCHAR:

It gives a path for citizenship for citizen -- for people who can become citizens. And it will be so much better for our economy in America.
GUTHRIE:

Senator, that's time. Thank you. Congressman Ryan, same question. Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border? Or should it be a civil offense only?
RYAN:

Well, I agree with Secretary Castro. I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they're deal in drugs and other things. That's already established in the law. So there's no need to repeat it.
And I think it's abhorrent -- we're talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here -- the way these kids are being treated. If you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States. That needs to stop.         And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids. What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who's so focused on hate and fear and division? And what has happened now, the end result is now we've got kids literally laying in their own snot, with three-week-old diapers that haven't been changed.
We've got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength, Mr. President. That is a sign of weakness.
GUTHRIE:

Senator Booker -- a lot of people -- they asked the question, if you're president on day one, what will you do with the fact that you will have families here? There's been a lot of talk about what you'll do in the first 100 days about legislation. What will you actually do with these families? How will you care for them? Will they be detained or will they not be?
BOOKER:

Well, this is a related and brief point, because what we're talking -- what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process.
I have been to some of the largest private prisons, which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration, and their immigration lockups. Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it's immigration, whether it's mental illness, whether it's addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem.
Donald Trump isn't solving this problem. We've seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the Northern Triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here, because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.
GUTHRIE:

All right, Senator, thank you. Let me go to Governor Inslee on this. What would you do on day one? Same question I just asked Cory Booker. I have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage.
INSLEE:

There is no reason...
GUTHRIE:

What will you do with the families that will be here?
INSLEE:

There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children. They should be released, pending their hearings, and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed. That's what should happen.
And we should do what we're doing in Washington state. I'm proud that we've passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini-ICE agents.
I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's heinous Muslim ban. I'm proud to be a person who's not only talked about Dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education, so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state.
And I'll leave you with this thought, if you want to know what I think. Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me -- he thought it was a threat -- to tell me that he would send refugees into Washington state if we passed a law that I passed. And I told him that's not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity as a strength. This is how we've built America. That tradition is going to continue if I'm president of the United States.
HOLT:

We're going to switch to another topic now. We've got a lot to get to. Let's...
DELANEY:

My grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country.
HOLT:

We're going to -- we're going to talk about Iran right now, because we're working against the clock. Tankers have been attacked. A U.S. drone has been shot down. There have been disturbing threats issued by both the U.S. and Iranian leadership.
I'd like if you can, just for a moment, to put aside how you think we may have gotten here, but what I want to know is, how do you dial it back? So a show of hands. Who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated? That's every -- well, Senator Booker, why not?
BOOKER:

May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we're seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled -- being pulled further and further into this crisis.
We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I'm not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I'm going to rejoin that deal. Because when I'm president of the United States, I'm going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I'm going to do it.
HOLT:

All right, Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to ask you to answer that question, because you've said -- you've said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement. Can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?
(UNKNOWN):

Yes, it was.
KLOBUCHAR:

It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that's something we could negotiate, to get back in the deal.
But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians, who claim now that they're going blow the caps on enriching uranium. And the Iranians have told us this.
And so that's where we are now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president. So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done.
And then, finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict -- and we're having this debate in Congress right now -- that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that.
And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war. And I don't think we should conduct foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning, which is what he does.
HOLT:

Congresswoman Gabbard, Congresswoman Gabbard, you've said you would sign back on to the 2015 deal. Would you -- would you insist, though, that it address Iran's support for Hezbollah?
GABBARD:

Let's deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran.
I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms' lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives. It would exacerbate the refugee crisis.         And it wouldn't be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war. This is why it's so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say no war with Iran. We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it.
It was an imperfect deal. There are issues, like their missile development, that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.
HOLT:

Your time is up. And this is a very quick follow-up. But what would your red line be that would -- for military action against Iran?
GABBARD:

Look, obviously, if there was an attack against the American -- our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is -- and it's important for us to recognize this -- is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others -- are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That's why we need to de-escalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride, put the American people first.
DE BLASIO:

Hey, but wait a minute...
GUTHRIE:

... we will have much more -- Mayor De Blasio, we'll have more. The commercial is coming, when we'll continue our questioning next with Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow. Stick around. We'll have a lot more with some very anxious candidates, just ahead.
HOLT:

And welcome back, everyone, to the first Democratic presidential debate from the Arsht Center in Miami.
GUTHRIE:

And as we continue the questioning, time to get more members of our team in the mix.
DIAZ-BALART:

So right now, let's turn it over to Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow. Take it away.
MADDOW:

All right. We're going to start by recapping the rules. Twenty candidates qualified for this first Democratic debate. We're going to hear from 10 tonight, 10 more tomorrow. The breakdown for each night was selected at random. Now, the candidates will have 60 seconds to answer, 30 seconds for a follow-up if necessary, and we will be ruthless, if necessary.
TODD:

We can do that.         (LAUGHTER)         By the way, hi, Rachel.
MADDOW:

Hi, Chuck.
TODD:

How are you doing?
MADDOW:

Good.
TODD:

And we've got a lot of ground to cover. We're going to be talking about guns and climate here up top. A whole lot more in this hour. Obviously, because of the size of the field, not every person will be able to weigh in on everything, but over the course of this next hour, we will hear from everyone, I promise, everybody.
TODD:

And to begin with, we're going to go with guns, and, Senator Warren, I want to start with you. We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since. Many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban, but even if implemented, there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country. Should there be a role for the federal government?
(UNKNOWN):

Their mikes are on.
TODD:

Everybody's mikes are on. I think we have a -- I heard that, too. That's OK. I think we had a little mike issue in the back.
MADDOW:

Control room, we've got...
TODD:

We had the -- I think we heard -- yeah, we have the audience audio. All right.         So the question is simply this. We're from -- I apologize you guys didn't get to hear this, the first part of the question. Obviously, we're not far from Parkland, Florida. Gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in Broward County.
Many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions. Some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban. But even if it's put in place, there are still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns still on the streets. Is there a role for the federal government in order to -- to play in order to get these guns off the streets?
MADDOW:

What's happening?
TODD:

We are hearing our colleague's audio. If the control room could turn off the mikes...
TODD:

Yeah, if the control room could turn off the mikes of our previous moderators, we will...
MADDOW:

You know, we've prepared for everything.
TODD:

Guess what, guys? We are going to take a quick break. We're going to get this technical situation fixed. We will be right back.
TODD:

We believe we have the technical difficulties fixed.
MADDOW:

Never say that.
TODD:

Never say never. But we will march forward here and I will lean forward here a little bit.
Senator Warren, we're going to get to the gun question here. In Parkland, Florida, it's just north of here in Broward County. As you know, it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue. It has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns, including assault weapons ban, but even if you're able to implement that, what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there? And does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it?
WARREN:

So, in this period of time that I have been running for president, I've had more than 100 town halls. I've taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions. And the single hardest questions I've gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl, and that is to say, when you're president, how are you going to keep us safe?
That's our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers. And they won't just die in mass shootings. They'll die on sidewalks, they'll die in playgrounds, they'll die in people's backyards.
Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country. And we need to treat it like that.
So what can we do? We can do the things that are sensible. We can do the universal background checks. We can ban the weapons of war. But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe. We need to treat this like the virus that's killing our children.
TODD:

OK, thank you, Senator Warren. You didn't address -- do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?
WARREN:

What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done. You know, guns in the hands of a collector who's had them for decades, who's never fired them, who takes safety seriously, that's very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly.
We can't treat this as an across-the-board problem. We have to treat it like a public health emergency. That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether it's politically popular or not.
TODD:

Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker, you have a program...
WARREN:

We need to fight for our children.
TODD:

Senator Booker, you have a federal government buyback program in your plan. How is that going to work?
BOOKER:

Well, first of all, I want to say, my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But what's even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I'm the only one -- I hope I'm the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year.
For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue. This is an urgency. And for those that have not been directly affected, they're tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school.
This is something that I'm tired of. And I'm tired of hearing people all, they have to offer is thoughts and prayers.
In my faith, people say faith without works is dead. So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal.
TODD:

Thank you, Senator Booker.
MADDOW:

Secretary Castro, I'd like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools, as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now. They don't make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll.
As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes? Or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?
CASTRO:

You know, Rachel, I am the dad of a 10-year-old girl, Carina, who's here tonight. And the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that's supposed to be safe.
The answer to your question is no. We don't have to accept that. And I believe that, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we're going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.
And the activists of Parkland, folks from Moms Demand who have risen up across the United States and inspired so many people... you know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we're getting closer. The House took a vote. In the Senate, the question often is, if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing commonsense gun reform, I'm going to choose commonsense gun reform. So I believe that we're going to be able to get that done in 2021.
TODD:

Secretary Castro, thank you.
RYAN:

Rachel, I have something to add to this briefly, because...
MADDOW:

We'll give you -- it'll be 30 seconds for a follow-up on that question -- on that answer from Secretary Castro. Congressman Ryan?
RYAN:

You're talking about in the schools. These kids are traumatized. I support all the gun reforms here. We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have. We need trauma-based care in every school. We need social and emotional learning in every school.
Ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they're in, and 73 percent of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied. We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school. That means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States. We need to start playing offense. If our kids are so traumatized that they're getting a gun and going into our schools, we're doing something wrong, too, and we need reform around trauma-based care.
MADDOW:

Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
TODD:

Congressman O'Rourke, you're a Texan who's campaigned -- you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there. What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else, OK, but says, you know what, the Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they're going to take my gun away, and even though I agree with you on all these other issues -- how do you have that conversation?
O'ROURKE:

Here's how we have that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe high school shooting, a young student named Bree. Her friend, Marcel, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks, where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives.
We talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they're stopped before it's too late. And what I found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun-owners and non-gun-owners alike, agreed. But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they've been able to change those laws. They're making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.
(CROSSTALK)         TODD:

Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.
Hang on. Let me give 30 seconds, Senator Klobuchar, the iron range. I'm curious. Gun confiscation, right? If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?
KLOBUCHAR:

Well, that's not confiscation. You could give them the offer to buy back their gun.
But I'll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand, coming from a proud hunting and fishing state? These proposals don't do that.         When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapons ban. When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change, and we all failed. And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift.
You know why? It's just like with gay marriage. When kids talked to their parents and their grandparents, they say I don't understand why we can't put these sensible things in place, they listen. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year-olds...
TODD:

All right, Senator, thank you.
KLOBUCHAR:

... it's the best thing that ever happened. We need to get...
TODD:

Senator, thank you. Senator, thank you.
MADDOW:

Senator Booker, let me go to you on another matter actually.
TODD:

We've got to...
MADDOW:

Senator Mitch McConnell says that his most consequential achievement as Senate majority leader was preventing President Obama from filling a Supreme Court seat. Having served with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, do you believe they would confirm your court nominees?
BOOKER:

I'm going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there's one thing we don't all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it's common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me. If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm.
And not everybody in this field agrees with that. But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns.
When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we -- I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro. We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate. This is a team sport. Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there.
This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn't so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.
MADDOW:

Mayor De Blasio...
DELANEY:

Rachel, we have to actually...
MADDOW:

Congressman Delaney, you'll have some time in a moment on this issue.
DELANEY:

This issue is related...
MADDOW:

Congressman Delaney, I'll give you some time in a moment. Mayor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen. If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?
DE BLASIO:

Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation's largest city, and I also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question.
Look, I run the largest police force in America, too, and if we're going to stop these shootings, we want to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community.
I also want to say there's something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is, for the last 21 years, I have been raising a black son in America. And I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son, Dante, about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police, too, as we saw recently in Indiana.
So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together. We've done that in New York City and we've driven down crime while we've done it.         But to your question about Mitch McConnell, there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with. If the Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again, and go into states, including red states, to convince people we're on their side, we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward...
MADDOW:

That's time.
TODD:

Senator Warren -- I'm going to get you -- I will get you 30 seconds, I promise. Let me get -- let me get this question. We're trying. I know you guys -- we've got other issues we're trying to get to, including a big one coming up in a minute. But, Senator Warren, I want to continue on the Mitch McConnell thing, because you have a lot of ambitious plans.
WARREN:

I do.
TODD:

You have a plan for that. OK. We talked about the Supreme Court. Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell if you don't beat him in the Senate, if he's still sitting there as the Senate majority leader? It's very plausible you be elected president with a Republican Senate. Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell?
WARREN:

I do.
We are democracy. And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters. Now, we have for far too long have had a Congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country.
They have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people.
Well, here's how I see this happening. Number one, sure, I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the Senate. But short of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on. It starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come January 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.
TODD:

I'm going to get to -- I'm going to get a couple of you in here.
I'm going to get a couple of you in here. Thirty seconds, Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner. Mitch McConnell doesn't operate that way. He operates differently. Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?
DELANEY:

I think we need to get things done. That's why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner.
Listen, I will sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party-line basis, absolutely. But all the big transformative things we've ever done in this country's history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions, not impossible promises.
We need to put forth ideas that work, whether it's on health care, creating universal health care so that every American gets health care, but not running on making private insurance illegal.
The gun issue is related. The gun safety issue is related, because I can't tell you how many times I've been with folks in Western Maryland, and they've said to me, you know, Democrats don't do anything for us, Republicans don't do anything for us. You fight all the time, so they vote on that single issue.
TODD:

OK.
DELANEY:

If we become the party of getting things done for the American people, with real solutions and not impossible promises, we'll be able to get all these things done.
TODD:

I promised...
TODD:

Senator Booker, 30 seconds. You -- how do you deal with Mitch? You've been in the Senate. You can't get bills on the floor right now with Mitch McConnell. Presidents can't do it. Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?
BOOKER:

You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African-American man in an African-American-dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform, from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.
And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done. As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate, built coalitions across the aisle, and today we passed the First Step Act.
It's not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated. I have gotten -- I have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve, and I've been able to get things accomplished.
TODD:

Thank you, Senator Booker. Rachel has got the next question.
MADDOW:

We are going to -- hold on. Governor, you're going to be happy with where we go.
TODD:

Just give us a second.
MADDOW:

Governor Inslee, the next question is to you. You got me?
INSLEE:

Rachel.
MADDOW:

You have staked your candidacy on the issue of climate change. It is first, second, and third priority for you. You've said it's all the issues.
Let's get specific. We're here in Miami, which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise. Parts of Miami Beach and the Keys could be underwater in our lifetimes. Does your plan save Miami?
INSLEE:

Yes, first by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell, to start with. We have to do that.
Look it, look it, we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last that can do something it. Our towns are burning. Our fields are flooding. Miami is inundated.
And we have to understand, this is a climate crisis, an emergency (OFF-MIKE) this is our last chance in the administration, next one, to do something about it. And we need to do what I've done in my state. We've passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill. We now have a vision statement. And my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work.
But the most important thing on this, in the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority? And I am the candidate and the only one who's saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what we've always done, lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work. That's what we're going to do.
MADDOW:

Governor Inslee, thank you.
TODD:

Congressman O'Rourke, you also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign. You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time, including switching to renewable energy, pushing to replace gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones. What's your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you're trying to do, but suddenly feels as if government's telling them how to live and ordering them how to live? What is that balance like?
O'ROURKE:

I think you've got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face. That's why we're traveling everywhere, listening to everyone.
We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa. And every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes, those farmers already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don't know what to do.
We in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We're going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years. We're going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels, and we're going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver's seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide.
If all of us does all that we can, then we're going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees Celsius, and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.
TODD:

Thirty seconds, Secretary Castro, does -- who pays for the mitigation to -- to climate, whether it's building sea walls, for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn't be living? Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? What do you do about that, where maybe they're building a place someplace that isn't safe? Who pays to build that house? And how much should the government be bailing them out?
CASTRO:

Well, I don't think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn't to Iowa or New Hampshire. It was to San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Because people should know that if I'm elected president, everybody will count. And, you know, I'm one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility, we began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than 800 jobs doing that.
And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way. That's the way that we're going to help make sure that we're all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change.
TODD:

Thank you.
CASTRO:

And if I'm elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also has said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that we lead again...
TODD:

All right. Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this. There are -- a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way. This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it's Washington state where voters voted it down, you've had the Yellow Vest Movement, we had in Australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer. If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?
RYAN:

Well, there is a variety of different ways to pay. We talked about different ways of raising revenue. And I think we've got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this.
But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics. We could talk about climate, we could talk about guns, we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about.
We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party. We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We've lost all connection. We have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elital -- elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years, to get those workers back on our side so we can say we're going to build electric vehicles, we're going to build solar panels.
But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working-class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out, and if you want to take Lindsey Graham out, you've got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina. So all I'm saying here...
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
RYAN:

All I'm saying here...
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
CASTRO:

So, Chuck, Chuck...
RYAN:

All I'm saying is here, if we don't address that fundamental problem with our connection to workers -- white, black, brown, gay, straight -- working-class people...
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman.
RYAN:

... none of this is going to get done, Chuck.
TODD:

Thank you very much.
(UNKNOWN):

Chuck...
TODD:

I want to you -- we're going to keep moving. Congressman Delaney, I'm going to get to you...
DELANEY:

This is -- I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill...
TODD:

Thirty seconds -- all right, 30 seconds, go.
DELANEY:

This is really important. All the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You can't put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people.
My proposal, which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people. It goes out one pocket, back in the other.
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman.
DELANEY:

I can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states.
TODD:

Thank you. Congressman, thank you.
DELANEY:

Because Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue.
TODD:

OK. Thank you very much.
DELANEY:

This has got to be our way forward if we're actually serious about this issue.
TODD:

Thank you.
Congresswoman Gabbard, we're going to move here. One of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the LGBT community about your past stances and statements on gay rights. After the Trump administration's rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community, why should voters in that community or voters that care about this issue in general trust you now?
GABBARD:

Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry.
My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act.
Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today.
I've served with LGBTQ servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that I'll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families. It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
BOOKER:

But it's not enough.
TODD:

Thank you, Congresswoman Gabbard.
BOOKER:

It's not enough. If I can add to this, it's very important.
TODD:

Thirty seconds, Senator.
BOOKER:

It's not enough. Look, civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African-Americans.
We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African-American trans Americans... and the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We don't talk enough about how many children, about 30 percent of LGBTQ kids, who do not go to school because of fear. It's not enough just to be on the Equality Act. I'm an original co-sponsor. We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in America.
(CROSSTALK)          MADDOW:

Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you. On the issue of civil rights, for decades -- on the civil rights and demographics, honestly, and politics, for decades, the Democratic Party has counted on African-American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level. Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way. What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you're your party's nominee?
KLOBUCHAR:

My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity. And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work. And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs.
In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead Democrat -- OK, that's a first up here -- was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs.
So to me, this is about a few things. It's about an African-American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. It's about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes.
So in short, we need, one -- and I will do this in my first 100 days as president -- we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table, everyone can vote in this country...
MADDOW:

That's time, Senator.
KLOBUCHAR:

... and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform. Senator Booker and I worked on that First Step Act, but we should go to the second step act, which is to help all our communities across our country.
MADDOW:

Senator, thank you very much. Thirty-second follow-up to you, Secretary Castro. This is a 70 percent Latino city here in Miami. You are the only Latino Democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race.
Is that enough of an answer, what Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda? Is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?
CASTRO:

Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice. And, you know, I was in Charleston not too long ago, and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emanuel AME church, and he murdered nine people who were worshipping, and then he was apprehended by police without incident.
Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio Arce? I'm proud that I'm the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is, that you're treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police.
MADDOW:

Secretary Castro, thank you.
TODD:

Let me go over to Lester Holt, who's got a question, I believe a viewer question.
HOLT:

And I'm over here, Chuck. Thanks. We asked voters from across the country to submit their questions to the candidates. Let me read one now. This comes from John in New York who submitted this question.
He asks, does the United States have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity? Do we have a responsibility to intervene to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect American core interests? I would like to direct that question to Congressman O'Rourke.
O'ROURKE:

John, appreciate the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.         But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He's diminished our standing in the world and he's made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it's Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.
He's embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together. That makes America stronger.
DE BLASIO:

But what about the War Powers Act?
MADDOW:

Congressman O'Rourke, thank you.
DE BLASIO:

What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation? With deep respect to the congressman, look, we've learned painful lessons as Americans that we've gone to war without congressional authorization.
And look, this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the U.S. Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off, and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life. And that battle didn't kill him, but that war did.
And, look, even in the humanitarian crisis -- and I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene, God forbid there is genocide -- but not without congressional approval. Democrats and Republicans both in the Congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval. We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten, that decisions have to be made by the United States Congress...
MADDOW:

I'm going to pick up -- I want to pick up this point, and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan. Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American servicemembers in Afghanistan. Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said that they want to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn't over for America. Why isn't it over? Why can't presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there? And how could you?
RYAN:

I appreciate that question. So I've been in Congress 17 years. And 12 of those years I've sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee.
And the lesson that I've learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it. It's long. It's tedious. But right now, we have -- so I would say we must be engaged in this. We must have our State Department engaged. We must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be.
But the reality of it is, this president doesn't even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things, whether we're talking about Central America, whether we're talking about Iran, whether we're talking about Afghanistan. We've got to be completely engaged.
And here's why, because these flare-ups distract us from the real problems in the country. If we're getting drones shot down for $130 million, because the president is distracted, that's $130 million that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio, or Flint, Michigan, or rebuilding -- or rebuilding...
MADDOW:

Congresswoman Gabbard, I'm going to give you 30 seconds, actually, to jump off what he said. He described engagement as the problem.
GABBARD:

Is that what you will tell -- is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan? Well, we just have to be engaged? As a soldier, I will tell you, that answer is unacceptable.
We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives. We've spent so much money. Money that's coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home.
We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began. This is why it's so important to have a president and commander-in-chief who knows the cost of war and who's ready to do the job on day one. I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office.
TODD:

Listen, I'm going to go down the line -- I'm going to go down -- I'm going to go down -- I'm going to go down the line here. You know what, you felt -- you felt like she was rebutting you. Get 30 seconds, go.
RYAN:

Thank you. You're a very good man. I appreciate that.
TODD:

Fair enough. I hear what you're saying. She invoked your name.
RYAN:

I would just say, I don't want to be engaged. I wish we were spending this money in places that I've represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding. But the reality of it is, if the United States isn't engaged, the Taliban will grow. And they will have bigger, bolder terrorist acts. We have got to have some presence there...
GABBARD:

The Taliban was there long before we came in. They're going to be there long before we leave.
RYAN:

And they were -- yeah, exactly. Well, we were.
GABBARD:

We cannot keep U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan thinking that we're going to somehow squash this Taliban that's been there, that every other country that's tried has failed.
RYAN:

I didn't say -- I didn't say squash them. I didn't say squash them. When we weren't in there, they started flying planes into our buildings. So I'm just saying right now we have an obligation...
GABBARD:

The Taliban didn't attack us on 9/11. Al Qaida did.
RYAN:

Well, I -- I understand...
GABBARD:

Al Qaida attacked us on 9/11. That's why I and so many other people joined the military, to go after Al Qaida, not the Taliban.
RYAN:

I understand that. The Taliban...
TODD:

Go ahead, Congressman. Finish up, 10 seconds.
RYAN:

The Taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us. All I'm saying is, if we want to go into elections, and we want to say that we've got to withdraw from the world, that's what President Trump is saying. We can't. I would love for us to.
GABBARD:

You know who's protecting Al Qaida right now? It's Saudi Arabia.
TODD:

I want to go down the line here, finish up foreign policy. It's a simple question. What is our -- what is the biggest threat -- what is -- who is the geopolitical threat to the United States? Just give me a one-word answer, Congressman Delaney.
DELANEY:

Could you repeat the question?
TODD:

Greatest geopolitical threat to the United States right now. Congressman Delaney?
DELANEY:

Well, the biggest geopolitical challenge is China. But the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons.
TODD:

OK.
DELANEY:

Right, so those are -- you know, those are different questions.
TODD:

I got you. Totally get it. Go ahead. Governor Inslee?
INSLEE:

The biggest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump. And there's no question about it.
TODD:

Congresswoman Gabbard?
GABBARD:

The greatest...
TODD:

Greatest geopolitical threat.
GABBARD:

The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we're in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
TODD:

Senator Klobuchar?
KLOBUCHAR:

Two threats, economic threat, China, but our major threat right now is what's going in the Mideast with Iran, if we don't get...
TODD:

OK, try to keep it at one -- slimmer than what we've been going here. One or two words.
O'ROURKE:

Our existential threat is climate change. We have to confront it before it's too late.
TODD:

Senator Warren?
INSLEE:

Climate change.
TODD:

Yeah. Senator Booker?
BOOKER:

Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
TODD:

Secretary Castro?
CASTRO:

China and climate change.
TODD:

Congressman Ryan?
RYAN:

China, without a question. They're wiping us around the world economically.
TODD:

And Mr. Mayor?
DE BLASIO:

Russia, because they're trying to undermine our democracy and they've been doing a pretty damn good job of it, and we need to stop them.
TODD:

All right. Well, thank you for that wide variety of answers, and I mean that. No, I mean that in -- that's what this debate is about. This is the best part of a debate like this.
Congressman O'Rourke, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump. House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House. If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller's report?
O'ROURKE:

Yes, and I'll tell you why.
TODD:

How, by the way? If the answer is yes.
One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States Capitol is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power, submitting to the rule of law and the will of people. That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.
If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard, and that is that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law. And we cannot allow that to stand.
So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy. And if we've not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows, and under my administration, our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice. It's the only way that we save this country.
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.
MADDOW:

Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O'Rourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the House, it raises the prospect -- and the Mueller Report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line. No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?
DELANEY:

I guess there's always a first.
MADDOW:

Should he be?
DELANEY:

I don't think anyone is above the law. I don't think anyone is above the law, including a president. I support Speaker Pelosi's decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker. I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined.
MADDOW:

Conceded. On the issue of prosecution...
DELANEY:

So -- but I do think -- I do think the -- no one is above the law, and this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law. But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you're out doing as much campaigning as I've done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number-one issue the American people ask us about.
It's not. They want to know what we're going to do for health care, how we're going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we're going to build infrastructure, what we're going to do to create jobs in their communities.
You know, last year in our country, 80 percent of the money for start-up businesses went to 50 counties in this country.
There's over 3,000 counties in this country. That's what they care about. They care about what's going on in the public schools. They care about what's going on with jobs in their communities, with their pay, with their health care, with infrastructure. These are the issues, these kind of kitchen-table, pocket-book issues...
MADDOW:

Understood.
DELANEY:

... are actually what most Americans care about. They never ask about the Mueller Report.
(CROSSTALK)          MADDOW:

Congressman, thank you. Your time is up.
DELANEY:

They never ask about it. They want to know how we're going to solve these problems.
MADDOW:

Your time's...
TODD:

Here's the thing. I still -- Senator...
KLOBUCHAR:

... but if we let the Republicans run our elections and if do not do something about Russian interference in the election and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the backup paper ballots, then we're not going to get what we want to do.
TODD:

I've got to sneak in -- we blew through a break, which was good news, to give you more time, so I got to sneak one in now. More of this debate. It's picking up here. It continues right after this.
HOLT:

We are back from Miami, and it's time now for closing statements. Each candidate has 45 seconds. We want to begin with former Congressman Delaney.
DELANEY:

Closing now?
HOLT:

Closing, 45 seconds. We could make -- we could go on.
DELANEY:

Together we are on a mission. We're on a mission to find the America that's been lost, lost through infighting, lost through inaction. We're so much better than this. We're a country that used to do things. We saved the world. We created the American dream for millions of people like myself, the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs.
But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises. And those are the roots that we have to get back to. I'm running for president to solve these problems, to build infrastructure, to fix our broken health care system, to invest in communities that have been left behind, to improve public education.
HOLT:

Your...
DELANEY:

I just don't want to be your president to be your president.
HOLT:

Congressman, your 45 seconds is over.
DELANEY:

I want to be your president to do the job.
HOLT:

Thank you, sir.
DELANEY:

This is not about me. This is about getting America working again.
HOLT:

Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)         GUTHRIE:

Mayor De Blasio. Mayor, your closing statement.
DE BLASIO:

It matters. It matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn't just talk about it, but gave people $15 minimum wage.
It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care. It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free.
These things really matter. And these are the things that I've done in New York and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters. We need to be that party again. Let's work together. With your help, we can put working people first again in America.
GUTHRIE:

Thank you, Mayor De Blasio. Right on time.
(APPLAUSE)         DIAZ-BALART:

Governor Inslee, 45 seconds.
INSLEE:

(OFF-MIKE) grandchildren, we love them all. And when I was thinking about whether to run for president, I made a decision. I decided that on my last day on Earth, I wanted to look them in the eye and tell them I did everything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis.
And I know to a moral certainty, if we do not have the next president who commits to this as the top priority, it won't get done. And I am the only candidate -- frankly, I'm surprised. I'm the only candidate who's made this commitment to make it the top priority.
If you join me in that recognition of how important this is, we can have a unified national mission. We can save ourselves. We can save our children. We can save our grandchildren. And we can save literally the life on this planet. This is our moment.
DIAZ-BALART:

Governor, thank you.
TODD:

Congressman Ryan, your 45 seconds.
RYAN:

There's nothing worse than not being heard. Nothing worse than not being seen. And I know that because I've represented for 17 years in Congress a forgotten community.
They've tried to divide us, who's white, who's black, who's gay, who's straight, who's a man, who's a woman. And they ran away with all the gold because they divided the working class. It's time for us to come together.
I don't know how you feel, but I'm ready to play some offense. I come from the middle of industrial America, but these problems are all over our country. There's a tent city in L.A. There's homeless people and people around our country who can't afford a home. It's time for us to get back on track. The teacher in Texas, the nurse in New Hampshire, the waitress in Wisconsin, all of us coming together, playing offense with an agenda that lifts everybody up.
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman.
RYAN:

I will only promise you one thing. When I walk into that Oval Office every morning, you will not be forgotten.
TODD:

Thank you, Congressman.
RYAN:

Your voice will be heard. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)         MADDOW:

Congresswoman Gabbard, you have 45 seconds for your closing.
GABBARD:

Our nation was founded on the principles of service above self, people who fled kings, who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people, coming here to this country, instead putting in place a government that is of, by, and for the people.
But that's not what we have. Instead, we have a government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful. This must end. As president, our White House -- our White House will be a beacon of light, providing hope and opportunity, ushering in a new century where every single person will be able to get the health care they need, where we will have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, where we will have good-paying jobs and a new green economy. Join me in ushering in this new century with peace, prosperity, opportunity, and justice for all.
MADDOW:

Congresswoman, thank you.
(APPLAUSE)         HOLT:

Secretary Castro, you have 45 seconds, sir.
CASTRO:

Me llamo Julian Castro, y estoy postolando por presidente de los Estados Unidos.
The very fact that I can say that tonight shows the progress that we have made in this country. Like many of you, I know the promise of America. My grandmother came here when she was 7 years old as an immigrant from Mexico, and just two generations later, one of her grandsons is serving in the United States Congress and the other one is running for president of the United States.
(APPLAUSE)         If I'm elected president, I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can get good health care, your child can get a good education, and that you can have good job opportunities, whether you live in a big city or a small town. And on January 20, 2021, we'll say adios to Donald Trump.
(APPLAUSE)         GUTHRIE:

Senator Klobuchar, the floor is yours.
KLOBUCHAR:

Three things to know about me. First, I listen to people and that's how I get things done. That is my focus. I have a track record of passing over 100 bills where I'm the lead Democrat. And that is because I listened and I acted. And I think that's important in a president. Everything else just melts away.
Secondly, I'm someone that can win and beat Donald trump. I have won every place, every race, and every time. I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and in Michigan.
And finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate. I've got respect, but I'm not that person. I am the one that doesn't have a political machine, that doesn't come from money. And I don't make all the promises that everyone up here makes.
But I can promise you this. I am going to govern with integrity. I'm going to (OFF-MIKE) I'm going to govern for you.

完整文字记录：2019年民主党辩论第一场，按主题排序（我们对辩论记录进行了注释，以便您可以在当晚的最重要问题上找到候选答案。）


Lester Holt：
各位晚上好。 我是Lester Holt，欢迎来到第一次民主党2020年总统竞选辩论现场。


Savannah Guthrie：
嗨，我是Savannah Guthrie。 今晚，这是我们第一次有机会看到这些候选人齐聚一堂。
我们的同事Jose Diaz-Balart，Chuck Todd和Rachel Maddow将在提问时间加入我们。
HOLT：
选民正试图确定候选人在问题上的立场，使他们与众不同，以及这些总统候选人中的哪一位有所需要。
GUTHRIE：
好吧，现在是时候找出来了。
播音员：
今晚，第一轮。 新泽西州参议员科里布克。 前房屋局局长朱利安卡斯特罗。 纽约市市长Bill De Blasio。 前马里兰州议员约翰德莱尼。 夏威夷国会女议员塔尔西加巴德。 华盛顿州长杰伊·英斯利。 明尼苏达州参议员Amy Klobuchar。 前德克萨斯州众议员Beto O'Rourke。 俄亥俄州众议员蒂姆瑞安。 和马萨诸塞州参议员伊丽莎白沃伦。
来自NBC新闻，“决定2020”，民主党候选人辩论，位于在佛罗里达州迈阿密的Adrienne Arsht表演艺术中心。
霍尔特：
大家好，晚上好。 欢迎来到迈阿密的艺术中心和全国各地的候选人和观众。 今晚我们将讨论当下许多最紧迫的问题，包括移民，边境地区的情况以及对移民儿童的待遇。
霍尔特：
大家好，晚上好。欢迎来到迈阿密的艺术中心和全国各地的候选人和观众。今晚我们将讨论当下许多最紧迫的问题，包括移民，边境地区的情况以及对流动儿童的待遇。
GUTHRIE：
我们将讨论与伊朗的紧张关系，气候变化，当然，我们将谈论经济，那些每天都有许多美国人面临的厨房餐桌问题。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
在开始之前讲一下规则。有20位候选人有资格参加第一次辩论。我们将在今晚10点和明天10点。每个的细分是随机选择的。候选人将有60秒的回答时间和30秒的跟进问题的回答。
霍尔特：
由于这个领域很大，并不是每个人都能对每个主题发表评论，但在接下来的两个小时内，我们会听到大家的意见。我们还想让观众将反应保持在最低限度。我们不会羞于确保候选人今晚能够保证遵守时间规则。
GUTHRIE：
行。因此随着辩论的开展，我们希望能够实现这一目标。我们今晚将与参议员伊丽莎白沃伦开始。
参议员，晚上好。
ELIZABETH WARREN：
谢谢。很高兴来到这里。
GUTHRIE：
你有很多计划 - 免费大学，免费托儿，政府医疗保健，学生债务取消，新税收，新规定，大公司解体。但就在此时，71％的美国人表示经济状况良好，其中包括60％的民主党人。你对那些担心这种重大变化对经济有风险的人有什么想说的么？
WARREN：
我是这样想的，这个经济体真的在为谁工作？它对那些顶层那些越来越少部分人而言是运行的挺好的。它对巨型制药公司来说也是非常好。对于那些试图获得处方药的人来说却并不是很好。它对那些想要投资私人监狱的人来说是非常好，但是却不是对那些非洲裔美国人和拉丁美洲人，他们的家庭被撕裂，生命被毁，社区被破坏。
对于那些想要到处钻探的大型石油公司来说，是非常好的，但是对我们这些正在面对气候变化影响的人而言却不好。
当你有一个政府，当你拥有一个对有钱的人有好处的经济而且对其他人来说并不好的经济时，这就是腐败，纯粹而简单。我们需要把它叫出来。我们需要先攻击它。我们需要在政府，经济和国家进行结构性变革。
GUTHRIE：
参议员Klobuchar，你把像“免费大学”之类的政策叫作，我这这里引用一下，“一个神奇的精灵”。坦率地说，你的一些竞争对手提供的政府计划和福利是否会让你的选民，对实际可以实现的目标产生错误的认识？
AMY KLOBUCHAR：


嗯，首先是经济。我们知道并非每个人都在分享这种繁荣。而唐纳德特朗普只是坐在白宫，并且正在享受对于正在发生的事情，但是同时这么多人没法支付大学学费，这么多人无法支付保险费。
因此，我确实担心这政策为有钱的孩子支付大学费用。我真的担心。但我认为我的计划很好。我的计划首先是让社区大学免费，并确保除了那些顶层的百分之几以外的其他人也都能获得教育方面的帮助。
我自己的父亲和姐姐在社区大学获得了第一个学位。成功的途径有很多，毕业证书也是。
其次，我也使用过Pell补助金。我将会将它们从每年6,000美元增加到12,000美元，并将其覆盖到家庭收入10万美元以下的家庭。
然后我要做的第三件事是让学生更容易还清学生贷款。因为我可以告诉你：如果亿万富翁可以买他们的游艇，学生也应该能够还清他们的学生贷款。
GUTHRIE：
时间到了，谢谢。国会议员奥罗克，我们刚刚讨论和讨论的是经济需要多大的根本改变以及实际可行的多少。在这种情况下，一些民主党人希望最高收入者（每年收入超过1000万美元的人）的边际个人税率为70％。你支持吗？如果没有，您的最高个人利率是多少？
BETO O'ROURKE：
这种经济必须为每个人服务。而现在，我们知道事实并非如此。这需要我们所有人聚在一起确保它确实如此。
O'ROURKE：
现在，我们的系统，有利于那些可以有钱支付买路钱和花钱买结果的人。这就是你如何解释一个被企业和最富有的人操纵的经济体。在历史性的财富不平等时期却减税2万亿美元以有利于坐拥创纪录的现金和最富裕的企业。
一个民主已经诞生，因为我们已经把权力归还给人民，没有PAC，没有不公正改划选区，自动化和当天的选民登记吸引更多的选民，新的选举权法案摆脱我们当今面对的一些障碍......
GUTHRIE：
国会议员奥罗克......
O'ROURKE：
这就是我们每个人在民主中发表意见的方式，并使这个经济为每个人服务。
GUTHRIE：
国会议员，是时候了，先生。如果你想回答直接问题，我会给你10秒回答。你会支持70％的个人边际税率吗？是，不，或通过？
O'ROURKE：
我会支持对所有人都公平的税率和税法。税收资本在同一个权利......
GUTHRIE：
百分之七十？
O'ROURKE：
.....对普通收入征税，将企业税率提高到28％将会产生收入......
GUTHRIE：
好的，到时间了。
O'ROURKE：
......可以用来需要支付我们正在谈论的项目。
GUTHRIE：
到时间了。谢谢。参议员布克，正如你所知，现在正在这个党内就公司的角色进行辩论。参议员沃伦特别提出了打破Facebook，亚马逊和谷歌等科技公司的计划。你已经说过，我们不应该引用“指责公司并在没有任何流程的情况下分解公司”。你为什么不同意？
CORY BOOKER：
我不认为我会不同意这种说法。我认为我们的企业整合存在严重问题。你看到了尊严从劳动中被剥夺，我们中有人从事全职工作却仍然无法获得维持生活的工资。
我们看到这些公司往往对药品拥有垄断权利的制药公司正在提高药品价格。你可以看到，我们经济实际上是一个损害小企业而不允许它们竞争的经济体。
我的关于农业部门的企业整合的法案是参议院处理企业整合的最激进的法案之一。所以我非常强烈地想要检查公司合并并让自由市场发挥作用。
我来会告诉你这个。我住在一个低收入的黑人和棕色社区。我每天都看到这种经济对普通美国人根本不起作用。那些正在使用的指标，从GDP到华尔街的排名，并没有帮助我所在社区的人民。现在是时候我们拥有一个适合每个人，而不仅仅是适合这个国家最富有的人的经济。
GUTHRIE：
但很快，参议员布克，你确实说过，你不认为点名公司并将其单独列出是正确的，正如参议员沃伦所说的那样。简而言之，为什么呢？
BOOKER：
好吧，再说一次，我会挑选出像哈里伯顿或亚马逊这样的不需要缴税的公司，我们需要改变这一点。在谈到反托拉斯法时，我要做的是，第一，指定将执行它的法官，第二，有司法部和联邦贸易委员会，将通过必要的程序来检查这种公司垄断。
最后，我们在企业权力增长方面存在太多问题。我们看到公民联合会的一切以及他们试图影响华盛顿的方式。现在是时候我们有一位为这个国家的人民而战的总统......
GUTHRIE：
先生，到时间了。
BOOKER：
我们需要有一个人为他们的冠军。
GUTHRIE：
谢谢，参议员。参议员沃伦，我提到你......
GUTHRIE：
你在挑选赢家和输家吗？
WARREN：
所以我理解这一点的方式，现在在这个国家的巨型行业中存在太多的联合。这伤害了工人，伤害了小企业，伤害了独立的农民，它整体上伤害了我们的经济。它限制了经济中的真正创新和增长。
我们早就有法律可以反击。缺少的是华盛顿里面的人的勇敢，那种承担巨人的勇气。这就是我们系统腐败的一部分。
长期以来，垄断者一直在为竞选活动做出贡献，为超级游说集团提供资金，在那里确保华盛顿做出的每一个决定中都能听到和感受到他们的影响力。在我想要开始的地方就是希望将政府归还给人民，这意味着要喊出垄断者的名字并说我有勇气去针对他们。
GUTHRIE：
谢谢。
霍尔特：
卡斯特罗部长，下一个问题是给你的。几十年来，民主党人一直在谈论薪酬差距。你会做些什么来确保女性在这个国家得到公平的报酬？
JULIÁNCASTRO：


非常感谢你提出这个问题，莱斯特。你知道我和我的兄弟Joaquin是由一位母亲带大。作为单身父母我知道挣扎是什么感觉。我知道租房子是什么样的，我知道担心你是否能够在月初支付租金所以妈妈非常非常努力地工作是怎样的，而且全国范围内因为她们是女性所以得到更少的薪酬。
我会做几件事，从我们很久以前应该做的事情开始，即最终在这个国家通过平等权利修正案。
并且还要通过立法，使妇女在这个国家获得同工同酬。过去我们这样做了。而且，你知道，我们必须这样做。如果我们想成为21世纪最繁荣的国家，我们需要确保女性得到应有的报酬。
霍尔特：
好的。谢谢你们。我想向国会女议员加巴德提出同样的问题。你对同工同酬的看法？
TULSI GABBARD：
首先，让我们认识到我们所处的状况，美国人民应该得到一位能够将你的利益置于富人和权贵之前的总统。那不是我们现在所拥有的这个。
在基地恐怖袭击事件发生在911事件之后，我参加了陆军国民警卫队，因此我可以追踪那天袭击我们的人。我现在仍然是一个少校。我服务了16年，在中东部署了两次，并在国会服务于外交和军事事务处超过六年。
我知道我们国家安全的重要性，也知道战争极高的代价。长期以来，我们的领导人都让我们失望，把我们从一场政权更迭战争带到了下一场，带领我们进入新的冷战和军备竞赛，耗费了数万亿我们辛苦赚来的纳税人的钱和无数的生命。
这种疯狂必须结束。作为总统，我将把你辛苦赚来的纳税人的钱花在投资上，用于满足你的需求，如医疗保健，绿色经济，高薪工作，保护环境等等。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
市长De Blasio，晚上好。你是美国最大城市的市长，但它也是富国和穷人之间差距最大的城市之一。您如何解决收入不平等问题？
BILL DE BLASIO：
我们一直在解决纽约市的收入不平等问题。包括提高工资，提高福利，把钱还给劳动人民手中，15美元的最低时薪工资，带薪病假，学前教育等等这些能改善劳动人民生活的措施。
但是让我告诉你，我们在第一轮问题中已经听到的我们在这里是为我们党的心灵和灵魂而战。我想说清楚。这应该是劳动人民的一方。是的，我们应该对富人征收70％的税率。是的，我们应该让我们的年轻人免费上大学，免费公立大学。当他们大公司不服务我们的民主时，我们应该打破他们。
这个民主党必须坚强，大胆，进步。在纽约，我们已经证明我们可以做一些非常不同的事情，我们可以把钱还给劳动人民。让我告诉你，每当你谈到投资于人和他们的社区时，你会听到人们说没有足够的资金。我每次都对他们说的是，这个世界上有很多钱，这个国家有很多钱。这只是在错误的手中。民主党人必须解决这个问题。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
国会议员德莱尼，你同意吗？
JOHN DELANEY：
我认为我们必须做真实的事情来帮助美国工人和美国人民。这是我们所有人在竞选活动中都听到的问题。我们需要确保每个人都有生活工资。我呼吁将所得税抵免额提高一倍，提高最低工资标准，并创造带薪家庭假。这将保证人们实际上足够生活工资。这对工人来说是正确的需要做的事情。
然后我们必须修复我们的公共教育系统。它没有提供我们孩子需要的结果，大学和高中毕业后的职业和技术培训计划也没有这样做。你知道，我和舞台上的其他人都非常不同。在进入国会之前，我是一名企业家。我开了两家公司。我创造了数千个工作岗位。我整个职业生涯都在帮助全国各地的中小型企业，我支持其中的5000家。奥巴马政府给了我一个奖励给弱势社区的奖励。
我知道如何创造就业机会。我们需要一个短期战略，即通过所得税抵免，提高最低工资和提供家庭事假来将钱存入工人的口袋，然后我们需要有一个长期战略来确保这个国家具有竞争力，并且在这个国家的各个地方都创造就业机会。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
谢谢。州长Inslee，您如何解决收入不平等问题？
JAY INSLEE：
好吧，我有点惊讶。我认为计划很棒，但我是州长。而且我们必须意识到那些带给我们周末，工会，需要给我们带来一个在美国长期延期的加薪。
我很自豪能够支持工会。我有一个重振集体谈判的计划，这样我们最终可以增加工资。我和SEIU人一起游行。麦当劳的首席执行官拿的钱比在麦当劳普通工人多出2100倍是不对的。
接下来我要做的就是让人们在当前和未来的工作中工作。看，唐纳德特朗普完全错了。他说风力涡轮机导致癌症。我们知道他们会带来工作。我们知道，我们可以让数百万人在未来的清洁能源工作中工作。
IBEW成员，机械师，我们今天在我的州。我们可以做美国一直做的事情：引领世界，创造未来，让人们去工作。这就是我们要做的......
迪亚兹 - BALART：
所以，特朗普总统的国会议员瑞安，你刚才提到他，他承诺制造业工作的都会回到了像你的家乡俄亥俄州这样的地方。你能做出同样的承诺吗？
TIM RYAN：
是的，我相信可以，但是，首先，让我们来看我们的现任总统，他说不要把房子卖给俄亥俄州扬斯敦的人。然后他的政府在过去两年里，我们在通用汽车工厂失去了4,000到4,000个工作岗位。整个社区都受到了影响。通用汽车被减税，通用汽车得到了救助，然后他们大胆地将他们要生产的新车工厂搬到墨西哥。
我有一些家庭成员，他们必须从机器车间拆下一台机器，把它放在一个盒子里，然后运到中国。我来自俄亥俄州东北部的地区，这个问题我们在这里谈论，它已经持续了40年。这不是美利坚合众国的新现象。
最低的60％的人民的收入自1980年以来没有增加。与此同时，前1％控制了90％的财富。我们需要一项产业政策，让我们将主导建设电动汽车，这在未来10年将有3000万辆市场。我想要一半在美国生产。我想主宰太阳能行业......
迪亚兹 - BALART：
谢谢。
RYAN：
......并在美国制造这些产品。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
参议员沃伦，他们回来了吗？这些工作会回来吗？
WARREN：
所以我们几十年来一直在美国制定了一项产业政策，基本上让大公司做任何他们想做的事情。巨型公司只有一个忠诚度，那就是利润。如果他们可以通过将工作转移到墨西哥或亚洲或加拿大来节省一毛钱，他们就会这样做。
所以这就是我对工业政策的建议。从一个真正需要的地方开始。世界各地都需要绿色技术，清洁空气的方法，清洁水的方法。我们可以提供这些。我们在研究和开发绿色能源方面需要十倍。
然后我们需要说任何公司都可以来使用该研究。他们可以从中生产各种产品，但必须在美国生产。
然后我们必须翻倍并在世界各地销售它。绿色产品有23万亿美元的市场。我们应该是领导者和所有者，我们应该在美国拥有120万个制造业工作岗位。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
谢谢。
WARREN：
我们做得到。
霍尔特：
行。我们现在要转向医疗保健问题，并真正尝试了解你们之间可能存在或不存在相同地方。许多在家观看的人通过雇主获得医疗保险。谁来取消他们的私人医疗保险，转而支持政府运作的计划？只是举手示意，开始吧。
好吧，参议员Klobuchar，让我向你提问。除政府医疗保健计划外，您还是希望保留私人保险的民主党人之一。为什么在您的观点中采用增量方法比彻底重头开始更好？
KLOBUCHAR：
嗯，我认为这是一个大胆的方法。这是巴拉克•奥巴马（Barack Obama）在制定“平价医疗法案”（Affordable Care Act）时想要做的事情。这是一个公共选择。我只是担心正如这个法案所说那样，四年内将一半的美国人从健康保险中强制退出。然后除此之外还有一个更大的问题，那就是药品。总统在福克斯电视上表示当人们看到他会降低制药价格的价格时，人们的头脑会开心的旋转。但是相反，自他上任以来，已有2,500种药物以两位数的速度增长，他给制药公司1000亿美元。
对于我们其他人而言，对美国其他人而言，这就是我们在家里所说的全是泡沫没有啤酒。我们什么也没得到。
所以我的建议是做一些关于制药的事情，拿下它们，允许在医疗法案下进行谈判，从其他国家引进更便宜的药物。制药公司认为他们控制华盛顿？好吧，他们不能控制我。
霍尔特：
你的时间到了。谢谢。参议员沃伦，你签署了伯尼桑德斯全民医疗保险计划。它基本上将所有人都放在医疗保险上，然后取消提供类似保险的私人计划。那是你作为总统追求的计划或路径吗？
WARREN：
所以，是的。我和伯尼一起参加全民医疗保险计划。让我告诉你原因。
我花了很长时间研究为什么家庭破产。其中一个原因是医疗费用，医疗费用。这不仅适用于没有保险的人。这包括有保险的人。
看看保险公司的商业模式。它可以带来尽可能多的美元保费，并为您的医疗保健支付尽可能少的美元。这使得家庭的保费越来越高，自付费用上涨，还要与保险公司的争斗才能试图获得他们的医生认为他们和他们的孩子所需要的医疗保健。全民医疗保险都能解决了这些问题。
我理解有很多政治家说，哦，这是不可能的，我们不能这样做，有很多政治原因。他们真正告诉你的是他们只是不会为此而战。那么，医疗保健是一项基本人权，我将争取基本人权......
霍尔特：
国会议员奥罗克，当你竞选参议员时，你还赞扬了一项取代私人保险的法案。今年，你说你不再确定。你能解释一下原因吗？
O'ROURKE：
我的目标是确保每个美国人都能够充分发挥其潜力，因为他们拥有医疗保健。在德克萨斯州的拉雷多，我遇到一位27岁的年轻人，告诉我他一生只去看过一次医生。在那次求医中，他被告知患有糖尿病，他被告知患有青光眼，并且他被告知他不得到治疗 - 因为他没有医疗保健 - 他将在40岁之前死亡。
因此，尽可能快速，可靠地得到高质量，全面的医疗保健必须成为我们的目标。能够负担处方和负担初级保健提供者 ，能够负担精神保健提供者。在德克萨斯州，最大的精神保健服务提供者是今天的县监狱系统。医疗保健也必须意味着每个女性都可以自己做出自己的身体决定，并且可以获得尽可能的护理。
我们的计划是，如果您没有保险，我们会为您报名参加医保。如果您投保不足，您无法负担保费，我们会为您报名参加医保。但是，如果你是一个工会的成员，并且为你的医疗保健计划进行谈判过，如果你觉的它更适合你和你的家人，你就可以保留它。
霍尔特：
你的时间到了。
O'ROURKE：
我们通过确保每个人都关心来保持选择。
霍尔特：
国会议员，你的时间到了，但我确实想要对此多问几句。只是答案要非常明确 - 我会给你10秒 - 你会取代私人保险吗？
O'ROURKE：
不，我认为这个选择对我们让每个人都得到照顾的能力至关重要......
DE BLASIO：
等等，等等。国会议员奥罗克，国会议员奥罗克，当你谈到共同支付，免赔额，保费和自付费用时，私人保险并没有为数千万美国人工作。它不起作用。你怎么能捍卫一个不起作用的系统？
O'ROURKE：
那就对了。因此，对于那些不工作的人，他们可以选择全民医保。为了...
DE BLASIO：
众议员...
O'ROURKE：
......我听谁...
DE BLASIO：
......你必须首先承认系统不能为人们服务。
O'ROURKE：
.....他们能够留住他们。
DE BLASIO：
你为什么一开始就捍卫私人保险？
DELANEY：
.....顺便说一下，有1亿美国人说他们喜欢他们的私人医疗保险。值得注意的是这有1亿美国人 - 所以我认为我们应该成为让这仍然正常运作并修补问题的一方。
我认为我们应该让这个国家的每个人的都有免费医疗保健作为基本人权。但我们也应该给他们购买私人保险的选择权。为什么我们拿走他们的选择权？这也是糟糕的政策。如果你去这个国家的每家医院，你问他们一个问题，如果你的每一张账单都以医疗保险费率支付，那么去年你会怎么样？每个医院管理员都表示会关闭。
并且所有账单的医保要求付款以保持当前的医保费率。因此，在某种程度上，我们将支持一项把每家医院都关闭法案。我爸爸是工会电工，我是在一个工人阶级家庭长大的。他喜欢IBEW给他的医疗保健。而且我总是从政策角度考虑我的父亲。他会看着我，他说，干得好，约翰，为每个美国人获得医疗保健。但是你为什么要把我的医疗保健带走？
霍尔特：
我很高兴听到你们之间的辩论。国会女议员加巴德，你对这个说法有何回应？
加巴德：
我想我们是以错误的方式谈论这个问题。你在谈论另一项法案取代一项法案。但我们讨论的是如何确保这个国家的每一个生病的美国人都能够获得他们所需的医疗保健。
我相信医疗保险是所有人的方式。我还认为，雇主将通过为所有计划支持全民医保来确认将节省多少资金，该计划将降低管理成本，减少官僚成本，并确保每个人都能获得他们所需的高质量医疗保健。
我也认为......
霍尔特：
参议员...
加伯德：
......如果你 - 如果你看看世界上其他拥有全民医疗保健服务的国家时，他们每个人都有某种形式的私人保险，所以我认为这就是我们必须思考的，借鉴这些最好的这些思路，但是我们要确保无论贫富，没有任何一个生病的美国人得不到他们需要的医疗照顾。
霍尔特：
国会女议员，国会女议员，谢谢。
霍尔特：
让我转向参议员布克。参议员布克，向我解释你的立场。这对人们来说非常重要。那么告诉我们你的立场。
BOOKER：
我绝对会表明我的立场。首先，我们将此视为一个医疗保健问题，但在我的社区，如低收入社区，这是一个教育问题，因为没有医疗保健的孩子不会在学校取得成功。这是一个工作和就业的问题，因为没有良好医疗保健的人不会在工作中取得成功。这甚至是一个退休问题，因为在我的社区，由于医疗保健较差，非洲裔美国人的预期寿命较低。
所以我的立场非常清楚。医疗保健 - 它不仅仅是一项人权，它应该是美国人的权利。而且我认为最好的方法是为所有人提供医疗保险。我对此感到很紧迫。当我担任美国总统时，我不会等待。我们必须立即做一些能够提供更好医疗的事情。在这场辩论中，我很抱歉。从制药公司到保险公司，太多人从美国人的痛苦中牟取暴利。
从字面上看，他们收取的保险费用为15％，而公办医保的费用仅为2％。我们可以做得更好。每一天我都为人们提供更多的医疗机会和更实惠的成本而奋斗，直到我们实现目标为止......
霍尔特：
参议员，你的时间到了。
BOOKER：
......每个美国人都有医疗保健。
霍尔特：
时间到了，参议员。我想要...
霍尔特：
如果可以的话，我想回到国会女议员加巴德......
WARREN：
......保险公司去年仅从医疗保健系统中就挣了230亿美元的利润，230亿美元啊。这还不包括支付给高管的资金，这些资金被用于游说华盛顿。
我们有一个巨大的行业，他们希望我们的医疗保健系统保持原样，虽然它不适用于家庭，但它肯定是为他们是很适用的。
WARREN：
现在是我们让家庭成为我们决策优先考虑对象的时候了。
INSLEE：
在美利坚合众国，任何保险公司都不应该拒绝让妇女行使其选择权。
我是这里唯一一个通过保护妇女健康保险生殖健康权的法律候选人，而且我也是唯一通过公共选择权法案的候选人。我尊重这里每个人的目标和计划，但我们确实有一个候选人实际上是领先的。而且我们必须能够覆盖到所有人。我已经把它作为公共选择法案来实现了。
霍尔特：
您的时间...
霍尔特：
参议员Klobuchar，我想要你...
未知：
这是一个错误的声明。
霍尔特：
我很好奇这段。参议员 - 参议员Klobuchar？
KLOBUCHAR：
我想说，这里有三位女士为女性的选择权而奋斗。我会从这开始。
我想说清楚，我认为我们有共同的医疗保健目标。我在以前提出的想法，即州长刚刚谈到的公共选择，这个想法是你在没有任何保险公司参与的情况下使用公共医保或公共医疗补助，两种选项你可以选择的用。据估计，有1300万人会看到他们的保费减少，另外还有12万人会被保险。所以我认为这是一个开始，你开始的方式和你转向全民医疗保健的方式。
霍尔特：
卡斯特罗部长，这个问题是给你的。舞台上的所有人都支持女性堕胎的权利。你们都支持某种版本的政府医疗保健。部长先生，你的计划会涵盖堕胎吗？
卡斯特罗：
是的，它会的。我不相信生殖自由，我相信生殖正义。
并且，你知道，这意味着，仅仅因为一个女人 - 我们也不会忽略跨性别社区中的某个人，一个跨性别女人，她是穷人，并不意味着他们不应该有权行使这种权利选择。所以我绝对会覆盖堕胎的权利。更重要的是，在这群人中观看并在家观看的每个人都知道，在今天我们国家，一个人的选择权受到密苏里州，阿拉巴马州，格鲁吉亚等地的攻击。我会任命理解并尊重Roe v.Wade先例的联邦法官来任职来确保我们努力为这些权利奋战，因为我们要将我们的医疗保健系统转变为每个人都能得到并行使这一权利的系统。
霍尔特：
参议员沃伦，你会限制 - 堕胎的限制吗？
WARREN：
我要确保每个妇女都能获得全方位的生殖保健服务，其中包括节育，包括堕胎，它包括妇女的一切。
我想补充一点。我们期望法院保护我们是不够的。四十七年前，Roe v.Wade法案已经出台了，我们所有人都一直在向法庭寻求帮助，但是州政府已经破坏了Roe，除了一些例外之外，这法案已经走到了取消的边缘...
霍尔特：
参议员，你的时间到了。
WARREN：
我们现在有一个美国，大多数人支持Roe v.Wade。我们需要制定一部联邦法律。
霍尔特：
参议员，谢谢。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
莱斯特，谢谢。参议员布克，我想回过头来讨论我们对健康和阿片类药物危机的讨论。您代表的所在的州里有全美20个最大的制药公司中的14个。生产这些药物的制药公司是否应对其所做的事承担刑事责任？
BOOKER：
他们绝对应该承担刑事责任，因为他们有责任和负责任。这是我竞选总统之前的原因之一，我不会从制药公司那里获得捐款，不会从公司PAC或制药公司高管那里获得捐款，因为他们是这个问题的一部分。
在我们的州，已经看到我们长久以来一直如何试图停止这种阿片类药物吸毒成瘾。现在是时候让我用有看待国家紧迫性问题来处理并使解决方案真正成为我们的法律，并且我们也需要使制药公司为他们所作负责。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
国会议员奥罗克，你会怎么处理它？
O'ROURKE：
今晚在这个国家，你们有230万我们的美国同胞被关在监狱里。这是地球上最多的监狱人数。许多人都有非暴力毒品犯罪，包括拥有大麻，而超过一半的州将其合法化或将其非罪化。
然而，尽管Purdue Pharma所做的事，他们与阿片类药物危机的关系和我们在这个国家看到的过量使用毒品死亡之间的关系。他们却能够完全不受惩罚地行事并且不会产生任何后果，他们不会被监狱中哪怕一夜。
除非有责任和正义，否则这场危机将继续存在。在我的政府中，我们将让他们对这负责。我们将确保他们付出代价，我们将帮助那些在这个国家里受这种渎职行为成为受害者的人获得治疗和长期护理。
霍尔特：
我知道在这里有很多移民。我想谈谈这个问题。我们将马上谈这个问题。我们需要休息一下。在此之后我们将从迈阿密回来。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
我们想转向新闻中的一个问题，特别是本周。有无证件的儿童被单独拘留，即使在佛罗里达州的霍姆斯特德附近，距离我们今晚不到30英里的地方。父亲和母亲以及孩子在试图进入美利坚合众国时正在经历死亡。
我们今天看到那张图片非常触动我们的心，他们的名字是奥斯卡·马丁内斯和他23个月大的女儿瓦莱里亚，他们在这个国家死去是因为他们想要要求过河去寻求庇护。上个月，在南部边境有超过130,000名移民被逮捕。
卡斯特罗部长，如果你今天担任总统，那么，你具体做什么？
卡斯特罗：
非常感谢，何塞。我很自豪，四月份我成为第一个提出全面移民计划的候选人。我们看到那些图像，看着奥斯卡和他的女儿瓦莱里亚的图片让令人心碎。它也应该让我们大吃一惊，它应该促使我们采取行动。如果我今天担任总统，我会签署一份行政命令，摆脱特朗普的零容忍政策，墨西哥移民滞留政策，以及移民审核政策 - 这种审核政策基本上是促使奥斯卡和瓦莱里亚进行冒险游泳过河的原因。他们一直在和其他一起即将到来的人玩游戏，并试图在我们的入境口岸寻求庇护。奥斯卡和瓦莱里亚去了一个入境口岸，然后他们被否决了他们提出的庇护申请，所以他们感到沮丧，他们试图过河，他们因此而死。
 


迪亚兹 - BALART：
在第一天。对不起，我只想问......
卡斯特罗：
在第一天，我会签署那个可以解决边界审核问题的行政命令。然后我会在我的前100天内通过移民改革来保证遵循这一点，这将改善庇护申请，这将使无证移民，只要他们没有犯下严重罪行，就可以有途径获得公民身份。
然后我们找到问题的根本原因，即我们需要为洪都拉斯，危地马拉和萨尔瓦多制定马歇尔计划，以便人们可以在家中就可以找到安全和机会，而不是到美国寻求。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
参议员布克，你会在当总统的第一天做什么？这是下一任总统将面临的情况。
BOOKER：
是。在第一天，我将确保第一，我们结束了违反人权的ICE政策和海关与边境政策。当人们来到这个国家时，他们不会将自己的人权留在边境。
第二...我将确保恢复DACA，我们恢复DACA接收者的公民身份的途径，并确保处于临时保护状态的人员可以留在并留在这里。
然后，最后，我们需要确保通过在北三角进行重大投资来解决使奥斯卡和瓦莱里亚成为首要问题，而不是像总统那样做，通过剥夺我们需要的资源放在边境，实际上是用牺牲我们的价值观来解决了这个问题，并认为我们将获得边境安全。但是这实际商使我们失去安全和我们的价值观。我们必须为两者而战。
卡斯特罗：


......如果可以的话 - 如果可能，非常简短，这是一个重点。你知道，我的计划 - 我很高兴看到参议员布克，沃伦参议员和部长Inslee 在此同意我。我的计划还包括废除“移民和国籍法”第1325条，我们将回到我们过去对待这种情况的方式，当有人来到边境时，不要将绝望定为犯罪，而只是将其视为违反民事行为。
（掌声）这就是为什么它很重要。当我们看到所有这些可怕的家庭分离。他们使用该法律，第1325节为根据将小孩与家人分开。
（未知）：
谢谢。
（未知）：
何塞·...
卡斯特罗：
因此，我想问一些这一阶段的每一位候选人是否以支持废除第1325条。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
三十秒
BOOKER：
正如我的朋友在这里所说的那样，我同意他的看法，但人们应该明白，儿童与家庭的分离不仅仅是在我们边境。它发生在我们的社区，因为ICE正在剥夺父母与美国孩子，配偶等的关系，并在全国各地的城市制造恐惧，父母害怕他们甚至放弃孩子上学或去上班。我们也必须结束这些政策。
DE BLASIO：
我们必须改变在这个国家的讨论......
迪亚兹 - BALART：
市长？
DE BLASIO：
......因为看看这里的底线。那些悲惨的 - 那些悲惨的照片 - 父母，那个孩子 - 我说这是父亲。每个美国人都应该感到，在他们心中，每个美国人都应该说不是美国，那些不是我们的价值观。
但是我们必须深入了解为什么我们的系统会出现这种危机，因为我们并不诚实地认为这个国家已经被煽动过。美国公民被告知移民以某种方式创造了他们的悲惨、痛苦以及他们面对的生活挑战。对于那些所有认为你落后于这个时代或感到美国梦不适合你的美国公民来说，移民并没有对你这样做。（掌声）是大公司对你这样做了。是美国前 1％的富豪们对你这样做了。我们需要成为劳动人民的一方，其中包括一个移民党。但首先，我们必须告诉那些受伤的美国劳动人民，我们是和他们一起的去反对那些一开始就制造这种混乱局面的大公司。
如果我们不改变那场辩论，这就会是我们的阻碍，我们就不会得到人们所谈论的所有这些改革。这就是我们作为民主党人需要做的事情。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
如果可以，我很抱歉。国会议员，白宫第一天你会做什么？
O'ROURKE：
我们不会拒绝瓦莱里亚和她的父亲奥斯卡。我们会接受他们进入这个国家并遵守我们自己的庇护法。我们不会建造墙壁。我们不会把孩子放在笼子里。事实上，我们将不遗余力地使已经分离的家庭重新团聚......我们不会在任何逃离暴力和迫害的家庭中起诉他们......
卡斯特罗：
......废除第1325条。
O'ROURKE：
我们会确保......
迪亚兹 - BALART：
部长，让他说完。我会给你......但让先说成。
O'ROURKE：
我们不会拘留任何逃离暴力的家庭，事实上，他们逃离了今天这个星球上最致命的国家。我们将实施一个家庭案例管理计划，以便他们可以在社区花很少的一部分成本就能得到照顾。然后，我们将以我们自己的形象重写我们的移民法，让任何梦想家永远免于被驱逐出境，让他们成为美国公民在这里，在中美洲投资解决方案，与地区利益相关者合作，让没有理由能让他们跋涉2000英里到这个国家。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
谢谢。秘书，我会给你30秒。
卡斯特罗：
我们要非常清楚。他们将这些小孩与家人分开的原因是，他们正在使用该法案的第1325条，该法案将跨越边界的行为定为犯罪，将父母关进监狱并将其分开。
在这个阶段，我们中的一些人已经呼吁结束该部分，以终止它。像国会议员奥罗克一样，有些人没有。我想要挑战所有没有的候选人。
卡斯特罗：
我认为这是一个错误，贝托。我认为这是一个错误。而且我认为 - 如果你真的想改变这个系统，那我们就必须废除那个部分。如果不...
迪亚兹 - BALART：
谢谢。
卡斯特罗：
.....那么它可能也是同一个政策。
O'ROURKE：
让我简单回答这个问题。作为国会议员，我帮助制定了立法，确保我们不会将在该国寻求庇护和避难的人定为刑事犯罪。
卡斯特罗：
我不是在谈论 - 我不是在谈论寻求庇护的人。
O'ROURKE：
如果你正在逃离 - 如果你正在逃避绝望，那么我想确保......
卡斯特罗：
我在谈论 - 我在谈论其他人。
O'ROURKE：
......我想确保你受到尊重。
卡斯特罗：
我还在谈论其他人。
O'ROURKE：
但是你只关注其中的一小部分。我在谈论全面改写我们的移民法。
卡斯特罗：
这不是真的。
O'ROURKE：
如果你这样做，我认为当他们来到这个国家时，人们要求他们遵守我们的法律。
卡斯特罗：
这实际上不是真的。我说的是数百万人 - 很多人即将到来并不寻求庇护。他们中的很多人都是无证移民，对吧？你最近说过，你不想废除第1325条的原因是因为你担心人口贩运和贩毒。
但是，请允许我告诉你：第18节，美国法典第18章，第21题和第22题，已涵盖人口贩运。
我认为你应该在这个问题上做功课。如果你在这个问题上做了功课，你会知道我们应该废除这一部分。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
这是一个我们应该而且可以谈论很长时间的问题。
DELANEY:
我们可以谈谈为什么人们来这里的吗？
迪亚兹 - BALART：
让我们 - 莱斯特 - 莱斯特 - 对不起，萨凡纳 - 我知道，这只是 - 我们可以继续下去。
DELANEY：
但是，我们真的不得不谈论为什么这些人来到我们国家......
GUTHRIE：
你会得到你的机会。
所幸：
.....以及我们要做些什么来真正改变这些国家。
GUTHRIE：
国会议员，你会得到你的机会。让我们继续讨论。
参议员Klobuchar ......
KLOBUCHAR：
是。
GUTHRIE：
让我们谈谈卡斯特罗部长刚才所说的话。他希望不再将非法越境视为犯罪行为。你支持吗？你认为它应该只是一种民事犯罪吗？如果是这样，您是否担心可能会激励人们来这里？
KLOBUCHAR：
移民，他们不会削弱美国。他们就是美国。我很高兴看到他的建议。但我确实认为你要确保你有适当的条款允许你追踪贩运者并允许你追捕那些违法的人。
我真正认为我们需要退后一步谈论的是经济上的迫切需要。那就是我们的财富500强企业中有70家由来自其他国家的人领导。我们美国诺贝尔奖获得者中有25％出生在其他国家。
我们现在有一种情况，我们需要在我们的领域和工厂中的工人。我们需要他们开办小企业。我们需要他们的想法。
在我们的经济需要移民的时候，这位总统确实倒退了。因此，我的建议是查看2013年通过参议院共和党支持的法案，以升级该法案，使其尽可能好并完成任务。它使债务减少了1580亿美元。
GUTHRIE：
参议员...
KLOBUCHAR：
它为公民提供了一条公民身份的道路 - 为可以成为公民的人提供。这对我们在美国的经济来说会好得多。
GUTHRIE：
参议员，那是时候了。谢谢。国会议员瑞安，同样的问题。非法越境是否属于犯罪行为？或者它应该只是一种民事犯罪？
雷恩：
好吧，我同意卡斯特罗部长的意见。我认为法律中还有其他规定，如果他们涉嫌毒品和其他事情，你可以起诉这些人。这已经在法律中确立了。所以没有必要重复它。
而且我认为这是令人憎恶的 - 我们正在谈论这个与他女儿一起被杀的父亲，以及这里的问题 - 这些孩子的待遇方式。如果你去关塔那摩湾，有些恐怖分子比那些试图越过边境的孩子获得更好的医疗保健。这种情况需要停止。而且我认为总统应立即要求医生和护士立即前往边境并开始照顾这些孩子。我们在这里经营的是哪个国家，我们的美国总统如此专注于仇恨，恐惧和分裂？而现在发生了什么，最终的结果是，现在我们已经让孩子地躺在他们自己的鼻涕中，他们用了三周的尿布都没有被换过。
总统先生，我们必须告诉这位总统，这不是力量的象征。这是一个弱点的迹象。
GUTHRIE：
参议员布克 - 很多人 - 他们问了一个问题，如果你是第一天的总统，你会对这些家庭怎么办？关于立法的前100天你做很多关于你会做什么的讨论。你会对这些家庭做些什么？你会如何照顾他们？他们会被拘留还是不会被拘留？
BOOKER：
嗯，这是一个相关而简短的观点，因为我们所说的 - 卡斯特罗和我所谈论的是，我们有权通过民事程序而不是刑事程序更好地处理这个问题。
我去过一些最大的私人监狱，这些私人监狱真的很让我反感，人们从监禁和移民关押中获利，我们的国家在将事情定为犯罪上犯了很多错误，无论是否移民，是否有精神疾病，是否有毒品成瘾。这不是处理问题的方法。有一种人道的并且在保证人权和人的尊严下实际上解决了这个问题方式。
唐纳德特朗普没有解决这个问题。我们在他的领导下看到一场边境的危机。我们应当通过在北三角投资来解决人们首先被驱赶到这里的原因，并且我们应该利用我们的资源来提供医疗保障以确认来人民的价值观和人类尊严。在这里，因为我们不能牺牲我们的价值观，我们国家的理想。我们可以通过正确的方式做到这两点。
GUTHRIE：
好的，参议员，谢谢。让我去看看INSLEE督察吧。你会在第一天做什么？同样的问题我刚问过Cory Booker。我还没有听到这个讲台上任何其他人的回答。
INSLEE：
没有理由...
GUTHRIE：
您将如何处理这些家庭？
INSLEE：
这些儿童没有理由被拘留和分居。他们应该在听证会之前被释放，他们应该举行听证会并遵守法律。那就是应该发生的事情。
我们应该做我们在华盛顿州所做的事情。我很自豪我们通过了一项法律，禁止当地执法部门成为迷你ICE代理商。
我很自豪能成为第一位反对唐纳德特朗普令人发指的穆斯林禁令的州长。我很自豪能成为一个不仅谈到梦想家，而且是第一个确保他们接受大学教育的人之一，以便他们能够实现自己的梦想。这些是我们州最鼓舞人心的人。
如果你想知道我的想法，我会留下这个想法。唐纳德特朗普前几天试图威胁我 - 他认为这是一种威胁 - 告诉我，如果我们通过了我已经通过的这个法律，他会把难民送到华盛顿州。我告诉他，这根本不是威胁。我们欢迎难民进入我们的州。我们认为多样性是一种力量。这就是我们建立美国的方式。如果我是美国总统，这种传统将继续下去。
霍尔特：
我们现在要切换到另一个话题。我们有很多事要做。让我们...
DELANEY：
我的祖父来到这个国家时，实际上与他的家人分开了。
霍尔特：
我们要 - 我们现在要谈谈伊朗，因为我们时间紧张。油轮遭到袭击。一架美国无人机被击落。美国和伊朗领导层都发出了令人不安的威胁。
我想，如果你可以，暂时搁置你认为我们为什么会如何弄到这个情形，我想知道的是，你怎么逆转时局回来？所以举手示意。谁作为总统将签署2015年核协议，因为它最初是通过谈判达成的？这就是每一个 - 参议员布克，为什么不呢？
BOOKER：
首先，退出这笔交易是错误的。我们现在看到这种敌意的原因之一是因为唐纳德特朗普正在把我们带到更危险的境地。从字面上看，他让我们摆脱了一项让我们透明核计划的协议，并推动了10年，20年的核突破。而现在我们看到伊朗威胁要走得更远，谁被拉扯 - 被进一步拉入这场危机。
我们需要重新谈判并重新达成协议，但我不会有一个主要平台单方面说我将重新加入这笔交易。因为当我担任美国总统时，我会尽我所能来保护这个国家和那个地区，并确保如果我有机会利用更好的协议的话我会去做。
霍尔特：
好吧，参议员Klobuchar，我想请你回答这个问题，因为你已经说过了 - 你说过你会谈判自己回到伊朗的协议中。你是否认为核批准的核协议是一个很好的协议？
（未知）：
是的。
KLOBUCHAR：
这是不完美的，但那个时刻是一个很好的交易。我本来可以努力获得更多时间以便重新获得交易，这是我们可以谈判的事情。
但重点是，唐纳德特朗普告诉我们，当他离开它时，他会给我们一个更好的交易。那是他的话。现在我们距离伊朗人还有一个月的时间，伊朗人现在宣称他们将在浓缩铀上大肆宣传。伊朗人告诉了我们这件事。
这就是我们现在所处的位置。他使我们比他们当总统时更不安全。所以我要做的就是与我们谈判达成协议，与我们的盟友保持一致，而不是给予中国和俄罗斯无限制的影响，这就是他所做的。
然后，最后，我会确保，如果有任何冲突的可能性 - 我们现在正在国会进行这次讨论是否给他来到国会获得军事授权。
这位总统几乎每天都会在距离发动战争的10分钟之内，一条推文就可以发动战争。而且我认为我们不应该在凌晨5点穿着浴袍来执行外交政策，但是这就是他所做的。
霍尔特：
国会女议员Gabbard，国会女议员Gabbard，你已经说过你会签署2015年的协议。你会 - 你会坚持认为它会解决伊朗对真主党的支持吗？
加伯德：
让我们来谈谈我们的情况，这位总统和他的鹰鹰内阁已经把我们带到了与伊朗的战争边缘。
我在2005年的战争高峰时期在伊拉克战争中服役，这场战争在我的4000多名兄弟姐妹牺牲了。美国人民需要明白，与伊朗的这场战争将更具破坏性，远比我们在伊拉克看到的任何事情都要昂贵得多。这将需要更多的生命。这会加剧难民危机。它不会只包含在伊朗境内。这将变成一场区域战争。这就是为什么我们每个人，每一个美国人站起来并且不与伊朗发生战争这一点非常重要。我们需要回到伊朗核协议，我们需要谈判如何改进它。
这是一个不完美的交易。有一些问题，比如他们的导弹发展，需要加以解决。我们可以同时做到这两点，以防止伊朗发展核武器，防止我们发动战争。
霍尔特：
你的时间到了。这是一个跟进问题。但是，对于对伊朗的军事行动，你的红线是什么？
加伯德：
显然，如果对美国人 - 我们的部队被攻击了，那么就必须有回应。但我的观点是 - 而且我们认识到这一点很重要 - 唐纳德特朗普和他的内阁，迈克庞培，约翰博尔顿和其他人 - 正在创造一种局面，他们制造的与伊朗的战争的火花，是非常危险的。这就是为什么我们需要缓和紧张局势。特朗普需要重新回到伊朗核协议并吞下他的骄傲，把美国人民放在第一位。
DE BLASIO：
嘿，但等一下......
GUTHRIE：
......我们会有更多 - 市长De Blasio，我们会有更多。广告时间之后我们将继续与Chuck Todd，Rachel Maddow进行更多讨论。
霍尔特：
欢迎大家回到迈阿密Arsht中心举行的第一次民主党总统辩论。
GUTHRIE：
我们继续提问时，让更多的团队成员参与其中。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
现在我们把它回到Chuck Todd和Rachel Maddow。
MADDOW：
行。我们将从重新制定规则开始。二十名候选人有资格参加第一次民主党辩论。我们今晚10个候选人，明天再另外10个候选人。每晚的候选人划分是随机选择的。现在，候选人将有60秒的时间回答，30秒的时间进行跟进问题回答，如有必要，我们将在必要时打断。
托德：
我们能做到这一点。 （笑声）顺便问一下，嗨，瑞秋。
MADDOW：
嗨，查克。
托德：
你好吗？
MADDOW：
好。
托德：
而且我们有很多领域需要覆盖。我们将在这里讨论枪支和气候问题。在这个小时里还有更多。显然，由于场地的大小，并不是每个人都能够充分发挥，但在接下来的一个小时里，我保证我们会听到每个人的声音。
托德：
首先，我们将讨论枪支，参议员沃伦，我想从你开始。我们距离佛罗里达州的帕克兰不到50英里，去年在一所学校开枪打死了17人，此后一直也有大规模的枪支暴力发生。你们中许多人都在呼吁恢复攻击性武器禁令，但即使实施，这个国家仍将有数亿支枪支。联邦政府应该发挥作用吗？
（未知）：
他们的麦克风正在打开。
托德：
每个人的麦克风都打开了。我想我们有 - 我也听说过。没关系。我想我们后面有一个麦克风的小问题。
MADDOW：
控制室，我们有......
托德：
我们有 - 我想我们听到了 - 是的，我们可以听到听众。行。所以问题就在于此。
我们来自 - 我很抱歉你们没有听到这个，问题的第一部分，我们离佛罗里达州帕克兰不远，在布劳沃德县，激进控枪主义运动已成为高中生活的重要组成部分。
你们许多人都在呼吁加强对枪支的限制。你们当中有些人要求恢复突击武器禁令。但即使它已经到位，仍然会有数亿支枪仍在街头。联邦政府是否有一个角色 - 为了让这些枪支脱离街道而发挥作用？
MADDOW：
发生了什么？
托德：
我们听到了同事的声音。如果控制室可以关掉麦克风......
托德：
是的，如果控制室可以关闭我们以前的麦克风，我们会......
MADDOW：
你知道，我们为一切做好了准备。
托德：
猜猜怎么样，伙计们？我们打算快点休息一下。我们将解决这个技术问题。我们马上回来。
托德：
我们认为我们已经解决了技术难题。
MADDOW：
永远不要这么说。
托德：
永远不要把话说绝了。但是我们将在这里向前迈进，我会向前迈的多一点。
参议员沃伦，我们将在这里找到枪支问题。在佛罗里达州的帕克兰，它位于布劳沃德县的北部。如你所知，它在枪支问题上创造了很多青少年活动。它激励了你们很多人提出更强大的枪支处理计划，包括攻击性武器禁令，但即使你能够实现这一点，你对那里已有的数亿支枪做了什么？联邦政府是否必须在处理这个问题上发挥作用？
WARREN：
所以，在我竞选总统的这段时间里，我有超过100个市政厅。我已经接受了2000多个未经过滤的问题。我遇到的最难的问题是从一个小男孩一个小女孩那里，当你当总统时，你怎么能保证我们的安全呢？
这是我们成年人的责任。今天将有7名儿童死于枪支暴力，儿童和青少年他们不会只是在大规模枪击事件中死亡，他们会死在人行道上，他们会在死在操场上，他们会死在人们的后院。
枪支暴力是该国的国家卫生突发事件。我们需要像那样对待它。
所以，我们能做些什么？我们可以做有如下的事情。我们可以进行背景调查。我们可以禁止战争武器。但我们也可以加倍研究，找出真正有效的方法，让我们的孩子保持安全。我们需要将此视为杀死我们孩子的病毒。
托德：
好的，谢谢你，参议员沃伦。你没有说明 - 你认为联邦政府需要去寻找一种方法来处理已经存在的枪支吗？
WARREN：
我认为我们需要做的是将它视为一个严重的研究问题，我们还没有这样做。你知道，枪手掌握在一个拥有它们几十年的收藏家手中，他们从未使用过他们，他们认真对待安全问题，这与那些被迅速销售和翻身的枪支截然不同。
我们不能将此视为一个全面的问题。我们必须将其视为突发公共卫生事件。这意味着要在这个国家做出真正的改变，无论它是否在政治上受欢迎。
托德：
谢谢，参议员。参议员布克，你有一个计划......
WARREN：
我们需要为我们的孩子而战。
托德：
参议员布克，你的计划中有联邦政府的回购计划。这怎么样？
BOOKER：
好吧，首先，我想说，我的同事和我都在竞选活动中听到了这一点。但更糟糕的是我在我邻居那听到了枪声。我想我是唯一的一个 - 我希望我是这个小组中唯一一个上周就有七个人在附近被枪击的那个人人。我认识的人Shahad Smith去年在我的街区顶部用突击步枪杀死了。
对于数百万美国人来说，这不是一个政策问题，这是一紧急事件。对于那些没有受到直接影响的人来说，他们已经厌倦了孩子们去学校学习阅读，写作和算术的同时还要在学校里应对积极的枪击。
这是我厌倦的事情。我厌倦了听到所有人提供的只是思想和祈祷。
在我的信仰中，没有行动的信仰就是死的。所以我们会找到一种方法。但我们现在遇到问题的原因是我们让公司枪支游说团队围绕这场辩论。现在是我们采取大胆行动和大胆议程的时候了。作为美国总统我将完成这份工作，这与政策无关。我已经把这个当成我自己个人的事了。
托德：
谢谢参议员布克。
MADDOW：
卡斯特罗部长，我想和你谈谈参议员布克刚才提到的事情，学校里主动射击训练的想法，因为学校枪击似乎几乎是每天或每周发生。无论死亡人数多少，他们都不会再制定完整的新闻周期报道了。
有的父母非常害怕他们的孩子会被卷入到这样的事情当中而退学，而联邦法律中几乎没有任何可能会影响学校枪击案的改变。这是一个在我们有生之年会继续恶化的问题吗？或者你作为总统会怎么做，你真的认为会扭转局面吗？
卡斯特罗：
你知道，雷切尔，我是一个10岁女孩Carina的父亲，她今晚在这里。最糟糕的是你的孩子可能会担心在学校——一个应该是安全的地方，会发生这些事情。
所以你的问题的答案是否定的。我们不必接受这一点。而且我相信，在2021年1月20日下午12:01，我们将会有一个民主党总统，民主党众议院和民主党参议员。
还有Parkland的积极分子，来自Moms Demand的人们，他们已经在美国各地兴起并激励了这么多人......你知道，我们可能还没有看到立法行动，但我们越来越近了。众议院投了票。在参议院，问题往往是，如果决定是在60票之间，在阻挠议案或通过常识性枪支改革直接，我将选择常识性的枪支改革。我相信我们将能够在2021年完成这项工作。
托德：
卡斯特罗部长，谢谢。
雷恩：
瑞秋，我有一些简要的补充，因为...
MADDOW：
我们会给你 - 关于这个问题的后续回答时间是30秒 - 在卡斯特罗部长的回答中。国会议员瑞恩？
雷恩：
你在学校里谈论的。这些孩子受到了创伤。我支持这里所有枪支改革想法。我们需要开始处理孩子们的创伤，我们在每所学校都有基于创伤的护理，我们需要在每所学校进行社交和情感学习。
发生学校枪击事件的射手中有百分之九十来自他们所在的学校，其中73％的人感到羞耻，精神创伤或被欺负。我们需要确保这些孩子与学校保持联系。这意味着美国每所学校的心理健康顾问。我们需要开始进攻。如果我们的孩子受到如此精神创伤以至于他们正在拿枪并进入我们的学校，我们也会做错事，我们需要围绕创伤护理进行改革。
MADDOW：
谢谢你，国会议员瑞安。
托德：
国会议员奥罗克，你是德克萨斯人的竞选者 - 你在2018年在全州最保守的部分进行竞选活动。你怎么告诉一个枪支所有者，他可能会同意你的一切，好吧，但是呢，你知道吗，民主党人，即使我在所有这些其他问题上同意你的意见，但是如果我在那里投票给他们，他们就会拿走我的枪， - 你如何进行这种对话？
O'ROURKE：
以下是我们在德克萨斯州进行对话的方式。我与他们分享了我从圣达菲高中射击幸存下来的学生那里学到的东西，一个名叫布里的年轻学生。她的朋友马塞尔在另一次枪击事件中幸存下来，是一名失去生命的受害者的母亲，朗达哈特，他们谈到了普遍的背景调查，在那里你关闭了每一个法律漏洞。我们知道他们拯救了生命。
我们谈到了停止向我们社区销售攻击性武器的问题。这些战争武器旨在尽可能有效和有效地杀害人民。他们应该属于战场，而不是我们的社区。
红旗法——如果有人对自己或其他人构成危险，他们就会在为时已晚之前被收缴武器。而我在这254个县中的每一个县都发现，民主党人，独立人士和共和党人，枪支拥有者和非枪支拥有者都同意这一点。但是，这项工作必须由您在本期开头提到的年轻人领导。来自Marjory Stoneman Douglas的学生在佛罗里达州领导了他们，他们已经能够改变这些法律。他们正在使我们的民主运作，确保我们的价值观和利益以及我们的优先事项能够反映在我们通过的法律中。
（CROSSTALK）TODD：
谢谢你，国会议员奥罗克。
等一会。让我给30秒，参议员Klobuchar，我很好奇。枪强制没收，对吗？如果政府回购，你怎么没有那次谈话？
KLOBUCHAR：
好吧，那不是没收。这是回购枪支。
但我会说这个。我看看这些建议，我说，这是否伤害了我的叔叔迪克和他的鹿站？他们一直是一个以狩猎和捕鱼为骄傲的州。这些建议不这样做。当我担任检察官时，我支持攻击性武器禁令。当我在参议院时，我看到桑迪胡克的那些妈妈来试图倡导改变，我们都失败了。然后现在这些来自佛罗里达州的Parkland孩子们实际上开始了全国性的转变。
你知道为什么？就像同性恋婚姻一样。当孩子们与他们的父母和他们的祖父母交谈时，他们说我不明白为什么我们不能把这些明智的东西放在适当的位置，他们会倾听。如果我们被一群17岁的孩子超越......
托德：
好的，参议员，谢谢。
KLOBUCHAR：
......这是有史以来最好的事情。我们需要......
托德：
参议员，谢谢。参议员，谢谢。
MADDOW：
参议员布克，让我谈谈另一件事。
托德：
我们必须......
MADDOW：
参议员米奇麦康奈尔说，他作为参议院多数党领袖的最重要成就是阻止奥巴马总统提名人填补最高法院席位。在司法委员会任职共和党人之经历，你相信他们会同意你的法庭提名人吗？
BOOKER：
我将使用20秒的时间来说，在枪支问题上我们并不同意一件事，我认为这是常识，超过70％的美国人同意我的看法。如果您需要驾驶汽车的许可证，您就应该需要拥有枪支的许可证才能购买枪。
并非这个领域的每个人都同意这一点。但在像康涅狄格州这样的州，他们看到枪支暴力下降了40％，自杀率下降了15％。我们需要开始对枪支进行大胆的议程。
谈到最高法院，非常清楚，我们 - 我同意我的朋友，卡斯特罗部长。我们将在参议院获得50票。这是一项团队运动。无论谁是我们的被提名者，都需要在南卡罗来纳州这样的地方竞选，因为我们可以选出杰米哈里森。他们需要在爱荷华州这样的地方开展竞选活动，因为我们可以在那里赢得参议院席位。
这是为了让我们回到参议院获得50或更多票，这样我们不仅可以平衡最高法院，而且开始通过一个积极的议程，坦率地说，并不是那么激进，因为大多数美国同意政策我们党的目标。
MADDOW：
市长De Blasio ......
DELANEY：
雷切尔，我们其实......
MADDOW：
国会议员德莱尼，你会在这个问题上有一些时间。
DELANEY：
这个问题有关...
MADDOW：
国会议员德莱尼，我马上给你一些时间。市长De Blasio，作为这个国家最大城市的首席执政长官，你习惯于说出你想要发生的事情并实现它。如果你作为美国总统提名最高法院提名人，米奇麦康奈尔仍然是参议院多数党领袖，那么是什么让你相信他会允许你的被提名人？
DE BLASIO：
雷切尔，我是这个国家最大城市的首席执政长官，我也想在枪支问题上简单说些什么，然后回答你的问题。
我在美国经营着最大的警察部队，如果我们要停止这些枪击事件，我们希望将这些枪支赶出街道，我们的警察和社区之间必须有一种截然不同的关系。
我还想说，有些东西让我与在这场竞选中的所有同事区别开来，在过去的21年里，我一直在美国养一个黑人儿子。我必须与我的儿子但丁进行非常非常认真的谈话，讨论如何在我们城市和整个国家的街道上保护自己，包括如何处理他必须特别小心的事实，因为那里正如我们最近在印第安纳州看到的那样，我们的年轻人和我们的警察之间的悲剧太多了。
因此，我们需要在这个国家进行关于枪支的不同对话，还有一个关于警务的不同对话，将警务社区聚集在一起。我们在纽约市已经做到了这一点，我们在完成的同时已经将犯罪其排除在外。但是对于你关于Mitch McConnell的问题，我们必须要有一个政治解决方案。如果民主党不再像精英党那样行动，再次成为劳动人民的一方，进入包括红州在内的州，说服我们也是站在他们一边的人，我们就可以向他们的参议员施压必须投票给提出的被提名人......
MADDOW：
时间到了。
托德：
参议员沃伦 - 我要去找你 - 我保证会给你30秒。让我 - 让我得到这个问题。我们正在努力。我知道你们 - 我们还有其他问题需要解决，包括一分钟内出现的大问题。但是，参议员沃伦，我想继续Mitch McConnell的事情，因为你有很多雄心勃勃的计划。
WARREN：
我确实有。
托德：
你有一个计划。好。我们谈到了最高法院。如果你没有在参议院击败他，如果他仍然作为参议院多数党领袖坐在那里，你是否有计划与Mitch McConnell打交道。你被选为总统而共和党仍然控制参议院是非常合理。你有计划与Mitch McConnell打交道吗？
WARREN：
我有。
我们是民主的。民主应该发挥作用的方式是通过实现人民意志。现在，我们长期以来在华盛顿召开的国会已经完全驳回了人们对这个国家的关心。
现在的国会为那些给巨额政治献金的人工作，为使用那些雇用大量游说者和律师的人工作，而不是为了人民。
好吧，这就是我看到这种情况的方式。第一，当然，我希望看到我们在参议院获得民主党多数席位。但是，如果没有民主党在参议院的多数席位，你更好地理解这场斗争仍在继续。它始于白宫，这意味着我们在2020年激励的每个人都将在2021年1月停留在前线。我们必须从外部推动，从内部发挥领导作用，并使国会反映人民的意志。
托德：
我要在这里 - 我会在这个问题上问你们几个。
我要在这里问下。三十秒，国会议员德莱尼，你似乎相信你可以以两党的方式做所有事情。米奇麦康奈尔不会那样运作。他却不同。为什么你认为他会配合你？
DELANEY：
我认为我们需要把事情做成。这就是为什么我认为我们需要以两党的方式运作。
听着，我将签署以白宫为基础的法案，绝对是以党派为基础的。但是，我们在这个国家历史上所做的所有重大变革事件都发生在大多数美国人民支持他们的时候，这就是为什么我们需要真正的解决方案，而不是不可能的承诺。
我们需要提出有效的想法，无论是医疗保健，创造全民医疗保健，以便每个美国人都得到医疗保健，而不是宣布私人保险非法。
枪支问题是相关的。共和国的枪支安全问题是有关系的，因为我无法告诉你我曾多次与马里兰州西部的人们在一起，而且他们已经对我说了，你知道，民主党人对我们没有做任何事，共和党人也没有为我们做任何事。而你一直在战斗，所以他们会就这个问题投票给你。
托德：
好。
DELANEY：
如果我们成为为美国人民做好事情的一方，通过真正的解决方案而非不可能的承诺，我们将能够完成所有这些事情。
托德：
我保证...
托德：
参议员布克，30秒。你 - 你怎么处理米奇？你参加过参议院。 和Mitch McConnell在一起工作现在是没法合作的。你当总统的话将如何应对？
BOOKER：
你知道，当我到达美国参议院时，回到De Blasio所说的，作为非洲裔美国人在非裔美国人占主导地位的社区，我知道最大的问题之一是刑事司法改革，来自警方的责任处理这样一个事实，即我们国家的在犯罪监督的非洲裔美国人比1850年的奴隶制下还多。
当我到参议院时，人们告诉我，我们无法完成全面的刑事司法改革法案。正如我在参议院的同事们所知，从我到参议院的那天起，我就在这条法案上进行了斗争，建立了联盟，今天我们通过了“第一步法案”。
这不是我想要的，但成千上万的人将被解放。我已经得到了 - 我接受了人们说我们无法实现的棘手问题，并且我已经能够完成任务。
托德：
谢谢参议员布克。雷切尔得到了下一个问题。
MADDOW：
我们要坚持下去。总督，你会对我们去的地方感到满意。
托德：
请给我们一秒钟。
MADDOW：
州长Inslee，下一个问题是给你的。你听到了么？
INSLEE：
雷切尔。
MADDOW：
你已经把你的候选资格放在了气候变化问题上。这是您的第一，第二和第三优先。你说过这都是问题所在。
让我们具体一点。我们在迈阿密，由于海平面上升，已经在阳光明媚的日子里经历了严重的洪水。迈阿密海滩和凯斯的部分地区在我们有生之年可能会在水下。你的计划拯救迈阿密吗？
INSLEE：
是的，首先从米奇麦康奈尔手中夺走阻挠议员。我们必须这样做。
看吧，看吧，我们是第一代感受到气候变化的第一代，我们是最后一个可以做到改变这一点的人。我们的城镇正在燃烧。我们的田地洪水泛滥。迈阿密被淹没了。
我们必须明白，这是一场气候危机，一场紧急事件（OFF-MIKE），这是我们进行管理的最后一次机会。而且我们需要做我在我的州所做的事情。我们通过了100％的清洁电网法案。我们现在有一个愿景声明。我的计划被称为让人们工作的黄金标准。
但对此最重要的是，在美国公众的最大决定中，谁将把这个作为第一要务？我是候选人中唯一一个说这必须成为美国的首要任务的人，我们必须组织并且动员美国以便我们能够做我们一直以来所做的事情——引领世界，发明未来并创造800万人工作职位。这就是我们要做的。
MADDOW：
州长Inslee，谢谢。
托德：
国会议员奥罗克，你也从你的竞选活动中制定了一个大的气候变化计划。你想在相当短的时间内做出一些重大改变，包括转向可再生能源，推动取代汽油动力汽车而转向电动汽车。你对支持你想要做的总体目标的选民的信息是什么，但突然觉得政府告诉他们如何生活并命令他们如何生活？这种平衡是什么样的？
O'ROURKE：
我认为你必须让每个人都参与到我们所面临挑战的决策和解决方案中。这就是为什么我们到处旅行，听取每个人的意见。
我们住在太平洋交界处，这个小镇以前从未有过洪水，现在就在爱荷华州的密苏里河上。那个社区的每个家庭都被洪水淹没了。太平洋交界处以外的农场现在实际上是湖泊了，那些受水灾的农民深陷负债，他们的国际市场在本届政府的贸易战中关闭，现在他们不知道该做什么。
在我们的政府中，我们在迈阿密，德克萨斯州休斯敦以及那些处于当今气候变化前沿的地区的社区中实现了资金弹性。在未来10年，我们将在这个经济体中动员5万亿美元。我们将摆脱对化石燃料的依赖，我们将把农民和牧场主放在首要的位置——可再生和可持续农业，以确保我们从空气中捕获更多的碳并保持更多的碳它在土壤中，向农民支付他们提供的环境服务付费。
如果我们所有人都尽我们所能，那么我们将能够让这个星球不再升温2摄氏度，并确保我们能够匹配这个国家能够做到的事情，并实现我们的承诺和潜力。
托德：
三十秒钟，卡斯特罗国务卿，无论是为了建造海堤，还是为了那些可能生活在他们不应居住的地方的人们，他们 - 为减轻气候而付出的代价 - 是为了减轻气候而付出的代价？这是一个需要这样做的联邦政府问题吗？他们必须搬出吗？你是怎么做的，也许他们在一个不安全的地方建造一个地方？谁支付建造那所房子？政府应该帮助他们多少钱？
卡斯特罗：
好吧，我认为这不代表绝大多数问题。事实上，你知道，我宣布参选后的第一次访问不是去爱荷华州或新罕布什尔州。是波多黎各圣胡安。
因为人们应该知道，如果我当选总统，那么每个人都会想想。而且，你知道，我是这场具有执行经验的少数候选人之一，并且有完成任务的记录。当我担任圣安东尼奥市长时，我们搬迁了当地的公用事业公司，我们开始将其从燃煤电厂转向太阳能和其他可再生能源，并创造了800多个工作岗位。
当我担任HUD秘书时，我们参与了全国灾难恢复竞赛，以便投资那些试图以可持续方式重建自然灾害的社区。这就是我们将帮助确保我们在未来几年更加安全并且我们应对气候变化的方式。
托德：
谢谢。
卡斯特罗：
如果我当选总统，我会做的第一件事就像参议员Klobuchar所说的那样，是签署了一份行政命令，让我们重新致力于巴黎气候协议，以便我们再次领导......
托德：
行。国会议员瑞恩，我在这里得到了一个完整的问题，就是这个。有很多气候计划包括定价碳，以某种方式对碳征税。这种类型的建议已经在一些地方受到尝试，无论是华盛顿州选民投票，还是黄色背心运动，我们在澳大利亚有一方因为担心气候变化成本被放在消费者的背上而遭到拒绝。如果定价碳在政治上是不可能的，我们如何为减缓气候做出努力？
雷恩：
嗯，有各种不同的方式。我们谈到了不同的增加收入的方式。而且我认为我们必须走出这条路，并逐渐摆脱这种局面。
但是，让我快速谈谈前一个关于真实政治的问题。我们可以谈论气候，我们可以谈论枪支，我们可以谈论我们都关心的所有这些问题。
我们对民主党有一个认知问题。在俄亥俄州工业中西部地区，我们并没有联系到工人阶级。我们失去了所有联系。我们必须改变民主党的重心，不再是沿海和精英 - 精英和常春藤联盟，这是对过去30年来被遗忘的社区的某些人的看法，工人们回到我们这边，所以我们可以说我们将要制造电动汽车，我们将要建造太阳能电池板。
但如果你想击败米奇麦康奈尔，这最好是一个工人阶级党。如果你想进入肯塔基州并把他的支持力量拿出来，如果你想把林赛格雷厄姆带出去，你必须有一个蓝领党派可以进入南卡罗来纳州的纺织社区。所以我在这里说的一切......
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员瑞安。
雷恩：
我在这里说的一切......
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员瑞安。
卡斯特罗：
所以，Chuck，Chuck ......
雷恩：
我所说的就是在这里，如果我们不解决与工人有关的那个根本问题 - 白人，黑人，棕色，同性恋，直工人阶级......
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员。
雷恩：
.....这一切都没有完，查克。
托德：
非常感谢你。
（未知）：
查...
托德：
我想要你 - 我们会继续前进。国会议员德莱尼，我要去找你......
DELANEY：
这是 - 我介绍了唯一的两党碳税法案......
托德：
三十秒 - 好吧，30秒，开始吧。
DELANEY：
这非常重要。所有经济学家都认为碳定价机制是有效的。你只需要做对。你不能为碳定价，提高能源价格，也不能把钱还给美国人民。
我的建议是对碳的定价，给美国人民带来红利。它从一个口袋里掏出来，回到另一个口袋里。
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员。
DELANEY：
我可以通过我在国会的每一位民主党人和居住在沿海国家的共和党人的联盟担任总统的第一年。
托德：
谢谢。国会议员，谢谢。
DELANEY：
因为在佛罗里达州的共和党人，他们实际上关心这个问题。
托德：
好。非常感谢你。
DELANEY：
如果我们真的认真对待这个问题，这必须成为我们前进的方向。
托德：
谢谢。
国会女议员加巴德，我们将搬到这里。您在推广活动后首先要做的事情之一就是向LGBT社区道歉，了解您过去的立场和对同性恋权利的陈述。在特朗普政府为该社区的许多人提供民权保护的退步后，为什么那个社区的选民或关心这个问题的选民还会信任你呢？
加伯德：
让我说，在我们的政府中，任何级别的人都没有权利告诉任何美国人应该允许他们去爱或者应该允许他们结婚。
我在国会的记录超过六年表明我致力于争取LGBTQ平等。我在平等核心小组任职，最近投票通过了“平等法”。
也许这个国家的很多人可以说我在一个社会保守的家里长大，在我很小的时候就持有我今天不再拥有的观点。
我曾在LGBTQ服务成员中担任过培训和部署过程。我知道他们会为我献出生命，我会为他们献出生命。这是我作为美国总统所承担的这一承诺，认识到仍然有人在工作场所面临歧视，仍然是那些无法为家人找到家园的人。我们需要解决这种歧视问题。
BOOKER：
但这还不够。
托德：
谢谢你，国会女议员加巴德。
BOOKER：
这不够。如果我可以补充一点，这非常重要。
托德：
三十秒，参议员。
BOOKER：
这不够。看，公民权利是开始的地方，但在非裔美国人的民权社会中，另一个需要关注的地方是阻止对非洲裔美国人的私刑。
我们没有充分谈论跨性别美国人，特别是非裔美国人的跨性别美国人......以及现在极高的谋杀率。我们没有充分谈论有多少孩子，大约30％的LGBTQ孩子，因为害怕而没有上学。仅仅遵守“平等法”还不够。我是原始的共同赞助商。我们需要有一位总统，每天都要为LGBTQ美国人保护美国的暴力行为。
（CROSSTALK）MADDOW：
参议员Klobuchar，让我把这个给你。关于民权问题，几十年来 - 关于公民权利和人口统计，坦白讲，还有政治，几十年来，民主党一直把非裔美国选民投票率作为在全国范围内赢得选举的第一步。民主党人现在和未来都以同样的方式指望拉丁裔社区。如果你是你的政党候选人，你对黑人和拉丁裔选民做了什么，他们应该为他们进行民意调查？
KLOBUCHAR：
我的生活和职业生涯以及我在参议院的工作都是关于经济机会的。对我而言，这意味着这个国家的每个人都能获得更好的托儿服务。当你想要一个有效的经济体时，你需要让退休生效，你需要有公立学校才能运作。而且你还需要确保这些社区能够获得未来的工作，即STEM工作。
事实上，唐纳德特朗普，他签署的第34条他签署的第一批法案，其中我是民主党的首席执行官 - 好的，这是第一个在这里 - 是一个关于这一点，确保少数族裔社区成员可以分享在那些工作。
所以对我来说，这只是一些事情。这是关于一位非洲裔美国女性去新奥尔良的一家医院，告诉医生说她的手肿了，然后医生无视她， 然后她和她的孩子死了。事实上，同样工作白人男性能挣1美元非洲裔美国女性只能赚61美分。
所以简而言之，我将在我担任总统的前100天内这样做 - 我们将努力确保每个人都可以在这个桌子上投票，每个人都可以在这个国家投票......
MADDOW：
时间到了，参议员。
KLOBUCHAR：
......我们还将进入刑事司法改革的下一步。参议员布克和我参与了“第一步法案”，但我们应该采取第二步行动，即帮助我们国家的所有社区。
MADDOW：
参议员，非常感谢你。卡斯特罗部长对你进行了第三十二次跟进。这是迈阿密70％的拉丁裔城市。你是今年在总统竞选中唯一一位在这里竞选的拉美裔民主党人。
那是一个足够的答案，参议员Klobuchar在那里描述了一个经济正义议程吗？这足以动员拉丁裔选民与民主党站在一起吗？
卡斯特罗：
嗯，我也认为我们必须承认种族和社会正义。而且，你知道，我不久前在查尔斯顿，我记得Dylann Roof去了Emanuel AME教堂，他谋杀了9名正在敬拜的人，然后没有任何意外，他被警方逮捕。
嗯，但Eric Garner和Tamir Rice，Laquan McDonald和Sandra Bland以及Pamela Turner和Antonio Arce怎么样？我很自豪我是迄今为止唯一提出改革美国警务制度的立法的候选人，并确保无论你的肤色是什么，你都受到同样的待遇，包括经常被警察虐待拉丁美洲人。
MADDOW：
卡斯特罗部长，谢谢。
托德：
让我回到Lester Holt，他有一个问题，我相信一个观众的问题。
霍尔特：
我在这里，查克。谢谢。我们要求全国各地的选民向候选人提问。我现在读一个。这来自纽约的John提交了这个问题。
他问道，在种族灭绝或危害人类罪的情况下，美国是否有责任保护？即使暴行不影响美国的核心利益，我们是否有责任进行干预以保护受其政府威胁的人民？我想把这个问题提交给国会议员奥罗克。
O'ROURKE：
约翰，很欣赏这个问题。答案是肯定的，但应该始终与盟友，合作伙伴和朋友一起采取行动。当美国提出统一战线时，我们有更好的机会实现我们的外交政策目标，防止你提到的那种种族灭绝，我们在卢旺达看到的那种种族灭绝，我们想要停止的那种种族灭绝往前走。但不幸的是，在这届政府执政期间，特朗普总统疏远了我们的盟友，我们的朋友和我们的联盟。他减少了我们在这个世界上的地位，他使我们变得更弱，作为一个国家，无力面对挑战，无论是伊朗，朝鲜还是俄罗斯的弗拉基米尔普京，他们在2016年袭击并入侵了我们的民主，特朗普总统又提出了邀请让外国做同样的事情。
他以牺牲伟大的民主国家为代价，接受了强人和独裁者。作为总统，我将确保我们在外交政策中践行我们的价值观。我将确保我们加强这些联盟，伙伴关系和友谊，并应对我们共同面临的任何挑战。这使美国更加强大。
DE BLASIO：
但战争权力法呢？
MADDOW：
国会议员奥罗克，谢谢。
DE BLASIO：
“战争权力法案”如何成为这个等式的一部分？看着国会议员深深的敬意，我们已经学会了痛苦的教训，因为我们在没有国会授权的情况下参加了战争。
这对我来说非常个人的问题了。我知道战争的代价。我父亲在第二次世界大战期间在太平洋服役于美国陆军，冲绳之战，他的腿被炸飞了一半，他带着身体和情感的伤疤回家，他没有康复，他情况越来越差，最终夺走了自己的生命。那场战斗并没有杀死他，但战争如此做了。
而且，看看，即使在人道主义危机中 - 我认为我们应该准备好，去干预种族灭绝 - 但不是没有国会批准。国会中的民主党人和共和党人都没有对总统提出质疑，并且让他们在未经国会批准的情况下动用军队。我们在越南学到了一个我们似乎已经忘记的教训，那就是那些决定必须由美国国会做出......
MADDOW：
我要 - 我想了解这一点，我想把它交给国会议员瑞恩。今天，塔利班声称有责任杀害两名在阿富汗的美国军人。与奥巴马总统和特朗普总统截然不同的领导人都表示，他们希望结束美国在阿富汗的活动，但美国并未结束。为什么不结束？为什么不能让不同党派和非常不同的气质的总统让我们离开那里？你怎么样？
雷恩：
我很感谢这个问题。我在国会已经17年了。这些年中有12年我曾参加过国防军服务委员会，国防拨款委员会或军事委员会。
多年来我学到的教训是，你必须坚持这些。没有人喜欢它。它的长，很乏味。但是现在，我们已经 - 所以我想我们必须参与其中。我们必须让国务院参与进来。我们必须在他们需要的范围内使用我们的军队。
但实际情况是，这位总统甚至没有让国务院任命人员处理这些事情，无论我们是在谈论中美洲，是在谈论伊朗，谈论阿富汗。我们必须让国务院人员参与。
这就是为什么，因为这些突发事件使我们分散了我国的实际问题。如果我们让被击落1.3亿美元无人驾驶飞机，因为总统的乱操作，我们可能把这个1.3亿美元在像扬斯敦，俄亥俄州或密歇根州弗林特这样的地方，或用来重建 - 重建......
MADDOW：
国会女议员Gabbard，实际上，我要给你30秒的时间来跳出他说的话。他将交战描述为问题。
加伯德：
这就是你要告诉的 - 你会告诉刚刚在阿富汗遇害的那两名士兵的父母吗？好吧，我们只是交战了？作为一名士兵，我会告诉你，这个答案是不可接受的。
我们必须把我们的部队从阿富汗带回家。我们在阿富汗的一个地方，我们失去了这么多的生命。我们花了这么多钱。从我们每个口袋里出来的钱，应该在家里进入社区的钱，满足家里人们的需求。
我们今天在阿富汗的情况并不比这场战争开始时好。这就是为什么拥有一位知道战争成本以及谁准备在第一天就能完成工作的总统和总司令如此重要的原因。当我走进椭圆形办公室时，我准备好做这项工作。
托德：
听着，我准备下线。你知道吗，你觉得 - 你觉得她在反驳你。给你30秒。
雷恩：
谢谢。你是个好人。我很感激。
托德：
很公平。我听到你在说什么。她援引了你的名字。
雷恩：
我只想说，我不想战争。我希望我们把这笔钱花在我所代表的那些完全被遗忘的地方，我们正在重建。但事实是，如果美国不参与，塔利班将会成长。他们将有更大胆，更大胆的恐怖主义行为。我们必须在那里有一些存在......
加伯德：
在我们进入之前很久，塔利班就在那里。他们将在我们离开前很久就在那里。
雷恩：
他们是 - 是的，确切地说。好吧，我们是。
加伯德：
我们不能让美国军队部署到阿富汗，以为我们会以某种方式压制已经存在的塔利班，其他所有尝试过的国家都失败了。
雷恩：
我没说 - 我没说压扁他们。我没说打败他们。当我们不在那里时，他们开始飞机进入我们的建筑物。所以我现在只是说我们有义务......
加伯德：
塔利班没有在9/11袭击我们。基地组织做到了。
雷恩：
好吧，我 - 我明白了......
加伯德：
“基地”组织于9/11袭击了我们。这就是为什么我和其他许多人加入军队，去追捕基地组织，而不是塔利班。
雷恩：
我明白那个。塔利班......
托德：
来吧，国会议员。完成，10秒。
雷恩：
塔利班正在保护那些策划反对我们的人。我只想说，如果我们想参加选举，我们想说我们必须退出世界，这就是特朗普总统所说的话。我们做不到。
加伯德：
你知道现在谁在保护基地组织吗？这是沙特阿拉伯。
托德：
我想这个问题在这里问下所有人，来结束外交政策部分。 这是一个简单的问题。 什么是最大的威胁 - 什么是 - 对美国的地缘政治威胁是什么？ 请给我一个单词的答案，国会议员德莱尼。
DELANEY：
你能重复一下这个问题吗？
托德：
现在对美国的地缘政治威胁最大是什么。 国会议员德莱尼？
DELANEY：
那么，最大的地缘政治挑战是中国。 但最大的地缘政治威胁仍然是核武器。
托德：
好。
DELANEY：
是的，所以那些 - 你知道，那些是不同的问题。
托德：
我听到了，我知道你的意思。 州长Inslee你的看法呢？
INSLEE：
唐纳德特朗普对美国安全构成最大威胁。 毫无疑问。
托德：
国会女议员加巴德？
加伯德：
最大的...
托德：
最大的地缘政治威胁。
加伯德：
我们面临的最大威胁是，我们今天的核战争风险比以往任何时候都要大。
托德：
参议员Klobuchar？
KLOBUCHAR：
两个威胁，经济威胁，中国，但我们现在面临的主要威胁是与伊朗在中东......
托德：
好吧，尽量保持一致 - 比我们在这里更加苗条。 一两个字。
O'ROURKE：
我们存在的威胁是气候变化。 我们必须在它为时已晚之前面对它。
托德：
参议员沃伦？
INSLEE：
气候变化。
托德：
参议员布克？
BOOKER：
核扩散和气候变化。
托德：
卡斯特罗部长？
卡斯特罗：
中国和气候变化。
托德：
国会议员瑞恩？
雷恩：
中国，没有问题。 他们在经济上在世界各地除去我们的影响力。
托德：
市长先生？
DE BLASIO：
俄罗斯，因为他们试图破坏我们的民主，而且他们在这方面一直做的很好，我们需要阻止他们。
托德：
行。好的，谢谢各种各样的答案，我的意思是。不，我的意思是 - 这就是这场辩论的内容。这是这样一场辩论中最好的部分。
国会议员奥罗克，特别顾问罗伯特·穆勒的报告概述了特朗普总统的多起潜在犯罪行为。众议院议长佩洛西公开和私下抵制任何在众议院弹劾的举动。如果众议院选择不弹劾，作为总统，你会采取任何措施来解决穆勒先生报告中提出的潜在罪行吗？
O'ROURKE：
是的，我会告诉你原因。
托德：
顺便问一下怎么样？如果答案是肯定的。
美国国会大厦中最具影响力的艺术作品之一是乔治华盛顿将军的特朗布尔画作，在他的权力最高的时候将他的委员会辞去大陆会议，服从法治和人民的意志。这经历了过去243年的时间考验。
如果我们现在又设立了另一个先例，那就是邀请外国势力参与的候选人，一位试图阻挠调查侵犯我们民主的总统，如果我们允许他完全不受惩罚地逃脱，那么我们就会有设定一个新的标准，那就是有些人，因为他们所拥有的权力和公信力的地位，都高于法律。我们不能允许这样做。
因此，我们现在必须开始弹劾，以便我们掌握事实和真相，并且我们尽可能地遵循它们，并且随着它们达到并且我们拯救这种民主。如果我们在今年或接下来的一年中无法做到这一点，并且在我的管理下，我们的司法部将追究这些事实并确保有后果，有问责制，并且有正义。这是我们拯救这个国家的唯一途径。
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员奥罗克。
MADDOW：
国会议员德莱尼，由于国会议员奥罗克刚刚在那里描述的问责制问题以及南希佩洛西所说的弹劾将不会在众议院进行的真实政治格局，它提出了前景 - 穆勒报告提出了预计特朗普总统可能因某些潜在的犯罪行为而受到起诉。在就职后，没有一位美国总统因犯罪被起诉。你相信特朗普总统能够或应该成为第一个吗？
DELANEY：
我想总会有第一个。
MADDOW：
他应该吗？
所幸：
我认为没有人凌驾于法律之上。我认为没有人凌驾于法律之上，包括总统。我支持议长Pelosi现在作为发言人在众议院作出的决定。我认为她更了解是否弹劾总统的决定比任何2020年候选人的总和还要多。
MADDOW：
关于起诉问题......
DELANEY：
所以 - 但我确实认为 - 我确实认为 - 没有人凌驾于法律之上，这位无法无天的总统不应该凌驾于法律之上。但是，我会告诉你，雷切尔，当你在外面做我所做的那么多的竞选活动，有400件事，在爱荷华州的所有99个县，这不是美国人民问我们的头号问题。
不是。他们想知道我们要为医疗保健做些什么，我们将如何降低医药价格，如何建设基础设施，以及我们将如何在社区创造就业机会。
你知道，去年在我国，初创企业80％的资金流向了这个国家的50个县。
这个国家有3000多个县。这就是他们关心的。他们关心公立学校的情况。他们关心社区中的工作，工资，医疗保健和基础设施。这些问题，这些厨房餐桌，口袋书问题......
MADDOW：
了解。
DELANEY：
.....实际上是大多数美国人关心的事情。他们从不询问穆勒报告。
（CROSSTALK）MADDOW：
国会议员，谢谢。你的时间到了。
DELANEY：
他们从不问过这件事。他们想知道我们将如何解决这些问题。
MADDOW：
你的时间......
托德：
这就是事情。我还是 - 参议员......
KLOBUCHAR：
......但如果我们让共和党人参加选举，如果不对俄罗斯干预选举做些什么，我们让米奇麦康奈尔停止所有备用纸质选票，那么我们就不会得到我们想做的事情。
托德：
我必须打断一下 - 下面是休息时间，我们将在在此之后继续。
霍尔特：
我们回到了迈阿密，现在是结束发言的时候了。每位候选人有45秒。我们想从前国会议员德莱尼开始。
DELANEY：
现在结束？
霍尔特：
结束，45秒。请继续。
DELANEY：
我们一起完成任务。我们的任务是找到失去的美国，通过内斗而失去的美国，通过无所作为而迷失。我们比这更好。我们是一个习惯做事的国家。我们拯救了世界。我们为像我这样的数百万人创造了美国梦，我是移民的孙子，工会电工的儿子，后来成为一名成功的商业领袖并创造了数千个就业机会。
我们用真正的解决方案来做这些事情，而不是用不可能的承诺。这些是我们必须回归的根源。我正在竞选总统来解决这些问题，建立基础设施，修复我们破碎的医疗保健系统，投资于落后的社区，以改善公共教育。
霍尔特：
您的...
DELANEY：
我只是不想成为你的总统而成为你的总统。
霍尔特：
国会议员，你的45秒结束了。
DELANEY：
我想成为你的总统来完成这项工作。
霍尔特：
谢谢你，先生。
所幸：
这不是关于我的。这是为了让美国重新开始工作。
霍尔特：
谢谢。
（掌管）GUTHRIE：
市长De Blasio。市长，你的结束语。
DE BLASIO：
在这场争取我们党的心灵和斗争的斗争中，提名一位经历过贫困，并不只是谈论贫困，给人们15美元的最低工资的候选人很重要。
重要的是，我们提名的候选人看到了破碎的医疗保健系统造成的破坏，并为人们提供全民医疗服务。重要的是，我们选择了一个看到我们的孩子在学前教育身上被浪费的潜力并且把学前教育免费赠送给他们每个人的人。
这些事情真的很重要。这些是我在纽约所做的事情，我想为整个国家做同样的事情，因为把工作人员放在第一位，这很重要。我们需要再次成为那个党派。我们一起工作吧。在您的帮助下，我们可以在美国再次将劳工放在首位。
GUTHRIE：
谢谢你，市长De Blasio。准时。
（掌声）DIAZ-BALART：
州长Inslee，45秒。
INSLEE：
（OFF-MIKE）孙子们，我们都爱他们。当我在考虑是否竞选总统时，我做出了决定。我决定在地球的最后一天，我想看看它们并告诉他们我尽一切可能保护他们免受气候危机的破坏。
而且我肯定地知道，如果我们没有下一任承诺将此作为首要任务的总统，那么它就无法完成。我是唯一的候选人 - 坦白说，我很惊讶。我是唯一一个将这一承诺作为首要任务的候选人。
如果你和我一起认识到这是多么重要，我们就可以有一个统一的国家使命。我们可以拯救自己。我们可以救我们的孩子。我们可以拯救我们的孙子孙女。我们可以从字面上拯救这个星球上的生命。这是我们的时刻。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
总督，谢谢。
托德：
国会议员瑞恩，你的45秒。
雷恩：
没有比听不到更糟的了。没有比没有看到更糟糕的事情。而且我知道，因为我在国会代表了17年的一个被遗忘的社区。
他们试图分裂我们，谁是白人，谁是黑人，谁是同性恋，谁是直人，谁是男人，谁是女人。他们带走了所有的财富，因为他们分裂了工人阶级。现在是我们走到一起的时候了。
我不知道你的感受，但我已经准备好发挥一些进攻。我来自美国工业中心，但这些问题遍布全国。洛杉矶有一个帐篷城市。那里有无家可归的人。我们该回到正轨了。德克萨斯州的老师，新罕布什尔州的护士，威斯康星州的女服务员，我们所有人都聚集在一起，开始一个提升所有人的议程。
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员。
雷恩：
我只会答应你一件事。每天早上走进椭圆形办公室时，你都不会忘记。
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员。
雷恩：
你的声音会被听到。谢谢。
（掌声）MADDOW：
国会女议员Gabbard，你有45秒钟的结束时间。
加伯德：
我们的国家建立在服务于自我的原则之上，逃离国王的人们，他们在人们的背上和牺牲中繁荣昌盛，来到这个国家，建立一个民有、民治、民享政府。
但那不是我们拥有的。相反，我们有一个由富人和强国组成的政府。这必须结束。作为总统，我们的白宫 - 我们的白宫将成为光明的灯塔，提供希望和机会，开启一个新世纪，每个人都能够获得他们需要的医疗保健，我们将拥有清洁的空气。呼吸和清洁饮用水，我们将有高薪工作和新的绿色经济。和我一起，为所有人带来和平，繁荣，机遇和正义，开启这个新世纪。
MADDOW：
国会女议员，谢谢。
（掌声）HOLT：
卡斯特罗部长，你有45秒，先生。
卡斯特罗：
(西语)Me llamo Julian Castro, y estoy postolando por presidente de los Estados Unidos.
我可以说今晚的事实表明我们在这个国家取得的进展。像你们许多人一样，我知道美国的承诺。我的祖母7岁时从墨西哥移民来到这里，仅仅两代之后，她的一个孙子在美国国会服务，另一个正在竞选美国总统。
（掌声）如果我当选总统，我会每天努力工作，以便你和你的家人能得到良好的医疗保健，你的孩子可以接受良好的教育，无论你是否住在一个大城市或一个小镇，你都可以有良好的工作机会。而在2021年1月20日，我们会向唐纳德特朗普说道adios（西班牙语，再见——译者注）。
（掌管）GUTHRIE：
参议员Klobuchar，你的。
KLOBUCHAR：
关于我的三件事。首先，我倾听别人的意见，这就是我如何完成工作。这是我的重点。我有超过100张法案的记录，我是民主党人。那是因为我听了，我采取了行动。而且我认为这对成为总统来说非常重要。其他问题将会随着这个消失。
其次，我是一个可以赢得并击败唐纳德特朗普的人。我赢得了每个地方，每场比赛，每一次。我赢得了最红的地区，在唐纳德特朗普以超过20分的优势获胜。我可以在威斯康星州和爱荷华州以及密歇根州赢得胜利。
最后，是的，我不是建制派成员。我从他们那得到了尊重，但我不是他们。我是那个没有政治机器在背后的人，没有自大金主在我背后。而且我不能给出这里所有人所给的承诺。
但我可以向你保证。我将以正直的方式执政。我要为你治理。
GUTHRIE：


谢谢，参议员。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
（用西班牙语讲）
BOOKER：
谢谢。五十年前的这个月，我的家人搬进了我长大的小镇，因为因为皮肤的颜色而被拒绝了房子，是活跃分子们，大多是白人活动家，站起来为他们而战。这是我们作为美国的最佳人选，以及为什么当我离开法学院时，我搬进了纽瓦克市中心作为其他人权利的租户律师的原因。
我接受了欺负并击败了他们。我接受了艰苦的战斗，我们赢了。我们赢得那些战斗，而不是通过成为最糟糕的人，而是展现最好的自己。
唐纳德特朗普希望我们在他的地盘和他的条件下与他作战。我们会打败他，我会再次称这个国家为共同目的而打败他。这是对他的公投和摆脱他，但它也是对我们的公投，我们是谁，我们必须是谁。
是时候我们赢得这次选举了。我管理的方式是成为我们可以成为的最好的人，因为这是这个国家需要和应得的。
迪亚兹 - BALART：
参议员，谢谢。
托德：
国会议员奥罗克，45秒。
我们的女儿莫莉本周11岁。我正站在这个舞台上，为了这个国家的孩子们，包括她的同龄人，他们已经与父母分开，今晚在铝制毯子下的混凝土地板上睡觉。
如果我们要为他们而存在，如果我们要面对我们所面临的挑战，我们就不能回到同样的老方法。我们需要一种新的政治形式，一种是由下一代的紧迫性引导的，那些气候活动家，他们不仅为了他们的未来而且为每个人而战，那些学生不仅为了他们的生命而且为了我们所有人的而奋斗。
我们需要像德克萨斯州那样的运动。它通过吸引所有人并且不排除任何人来重振我们的民主。这就是我们击败唐纳德特朗普的方式。这就是我们如何将这个伟大的国家再次聚集在一起。加入我们。这是我们的时刻。接下来几代人都指望我们去迎接它。
托德：
谢谢你，国会议员。
MADDOW：
参议员沃伦，你有45秒的时间进行最后的最后声明。
WARREN：
谢谢。能够来到这里真是太荣幸了。就是一百万年我也不会认为我会站在这样的舞台上。我出生在俄克拉荷马州。我有三个哥哥。他们都加入了军队。
我有一个成长的梦想。我的梦想是成为一名公立学校的老师。当我从高中毕业时，我的家人 - 我的家人没有钱申请大学，更不用说我上大学的机会了。
但我抓住了机会。这是一学期的50美元的通勤学院。这只是政府的一小部分，为一个女孩创造了一些机会。它开启了我的生活。
我正在参与这场斗争，因为我相信我们可以建立我们的政府，我们可以创造经济，我们可以使我们的国家不仅仅为那些顶尖的人工作。我们可以让它适合每个人。而且我向你保证：我会像为自己的家人一样努力为你而战。
（掌管）GUTHRIE：
我们要感谢今晚与我们一起参加的所有候选人。这将是这个两晚活动的夜晚之一。你猜怎么着？我们明天晚上还有10名候选人。
霍尔特：
我们当然希望你能加入我们。但就目前而言，这结束了我们对迈阿密第一次民主党辩论的报道。对于萨凡纳，何塞，查克和瑞秋，我是莱斯特霍尔特。每个人都有一个美好的夜晚。
